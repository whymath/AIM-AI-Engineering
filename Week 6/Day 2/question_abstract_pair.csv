39,What is the significance of the small unregarded yellow sun in the context of the story?,"Chapter 0
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western
spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly
insigniﬁcant little blue green planet whose apedescended life forms are so amaz-
ingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the
people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were
suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the
movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it
wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of
them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake
in coming down from the trees in the ﬁrst place. And some said that even the
trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been
nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a
change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly
realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she ﬁnally
knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a
terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its conse-
quences.
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible
catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the
great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard
either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one
- more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than
Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon
Colluphid’s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some

movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it
wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of
them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake
in coming down from the trees in the ﬁrst place. And some said that even the
trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been
nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a
change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly
realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she ﬁnally
knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a
terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its conse-

It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible
catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the
great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard
either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one

54,What is the main reason Arthur Dent finds his house special?,"Chapter 1
The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its
own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remark-
able house by any means - it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish,
made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion
which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur
Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He
had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London
because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark
haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him
most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so
worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends
was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of
his friends worked in advertising.
It hadn’t properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock
down his house and build an bypass instead.
At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke
up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a
bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped oﬀ to the bathroom to wash.
Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub.
Shaving mirror-pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it
reﬂected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted,
it reﬂected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them oﬀ, washed, dried, and
stomped oﬀ to the kitchen to ﬁnd something pleasant to put in his mouth.
Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coﬀee. Yawn.
The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of
something to connect with.
The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.
He stared at it.
- Yellow, - he thought and stomped oﬀ back to his bedroom to get dressed.
Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another.
He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he
been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He
caught a glint in the shaving mirror. ”Yellow,” he thought and stomped on to
the bedroom.

The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its
own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remark-
able house by any means - it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish,
made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion
which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur
Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He
had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London
because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark
haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him
most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so
worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends
was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of
his friends worked in advertising.
It hadn’t properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock
down his house and build an bypass instead.
At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke
up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a
bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped oﬀ to the bathroom to wash.
Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub.
Shaving mirror-pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it
reﬂected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted,
it reﬂected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them oﬀ, washed, dried, and
stomped oﬀ to the kitchen to ﬁnd something pleasant to put in his mouth.
Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coﬀee. Yawn.
The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of
something to connect with.
The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.
He stared at it.
- Yellow, - he thought and stomped oﬀ back to his bedroom to get dressed.
Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another.
He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he
been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He
caught a glint in the shaving mirror. ”Yellow,” he thought and stomped on to
the bedroom.
He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely
remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d

suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s

been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it.
Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’d decided, no
one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort
itself out.
God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself
in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. ”Yellow,” he thought. The
word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with.
Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big
yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.
Mr. L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a
carbon-based life form descended from an ape. More speciﬁcally he was forty,
fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though
he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan,
though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that
he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in
Mr. L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the
tum and a predilection for little fur hats.
He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man.
Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone
seriously wrong with his job - which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got
cleared out of the way before the day was out.
- Come oﬀ it, Mr. Dent, - he said, - you can’t win you know. You can’t lie
in front of the bulldozer indeﬁnitely. - He tried to make his eyes blaze ﬁercely
but they just wouldn’t do it.
Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.
- I’m game, - he said, - we’ll see who rusts ﬁrst.
- I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it, - said Mr. Prosser gripping
his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, - this bypass has got to be
built and it’s going to be built!
- First I’ve heard of it, - said Arthur, - why’s it going to be built?

bulldozer drivers.
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on
each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to

Mr. Prosser said:
- You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appro-
priate time you know.
- Appropriate time? - hooted Arthur. - Appropriate time? The ﬁrst I knew
about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d
come to clean the windows and he said no he’d come to demolish the house.
He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of
windows and charged me a ﬁver. Then he told me.
- But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning oﬃce
for the last nine month.
- Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday
afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them
had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.
- But the plans were on display...
- On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to ﬁnd them.
- That’s the display department.
- With a torch.
- Ah, well the lights had probably gone.
- So had the stairs.
- But look, you found the notice didn’t you?
- Yes, - said Arthur, - yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked
ﬁling cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware
of the Leopard.
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay
propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s
house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it.
- It’s not as if it’s a particularly nice house, - he said.
- I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.

for a moment ﬁlled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur
Dent’s house being consumed with ﬁre and Arthur himself running screaming
from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.
Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel

that bulldozer would suﬀer if I just let it roll straight over you?

that bulldozer would suﬀer if I just let it roll straight over you?
- How much? - said Arthur.
- None at all, - said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously oﬀ wondering why
his brain was ﬁlled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him."
71,Where did Arthur Dent eventually find the plans for the bypass?,"11
know why - he just liked axes. He ﬂushed hotly under the derisive grins of the
bulldozer drivers.
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on
each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to
God it wasn’t him.
Mr. Prosser said:
- You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appro-
priate time you know.
- Appropriate time? - hooted Arthur. - Appropriate time? The ﬁrst I knew
about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d
come to clean the windows and he said no he’d come to demolish the house.
He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of
windows and charged me a ﬁver. Then he told me.
- But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning oﬃce
for the last nine month.
- Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday
afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them
had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.
- But the plans were on display...
- On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to ﬁnd them.
- That’s the display department.
- With a torch.
- Ah, well the lights had probably gone.
- So had the stairs.
- But look, you found the notice didn’t you?
- Yes, - said Arthur, - yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked
ﬁling cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware
of the Leopard.
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay
propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s
house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it.
- It’s not as if it’s a particularly nice house, - he said.
- I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.
- You’ll like the bypass.
- Oh shut up, - said Arthur Dent. - Shut up and go away, and take your
bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.
Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was
for a moment ﬁlled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur
Dent’s house being consumed with ﬁre and Arthur himself running screaming
from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.
Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel
very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.

79,What was the name chosen by Ford Prefect to blend into Earth society?,"12 CHAPTER 1.
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-
descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended
from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse
and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.
This friend of his had ﬁrst arrived on the planet some ﬁfteen Earth years
previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society - with,
it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those ﬁfteen years
pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit
on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to
choose the name ”Ford Prefect” as being nicely inconspicuous.
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicu-
ously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from
the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There
was something very slightly odd about him, but it was diﬃcult to say what
it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn’t blink often enough and when you
talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on
his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people
the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but
a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he
would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun
of any astrophysicist he could ﬁnd till he got thrown out.
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into
the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he
would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.
- Oh, just looking for ﬂying saucers, - he would joke and everyone would
laugh and ask him what sort of ﬂying saucers he was looking for.
- Green ones! - he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment
and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of
drinks.
Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on
whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases
that honestly the colour of the ﬂying saucers didn’t matter that much really.
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often
ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would
usually say something like:
- Don’t you think it’s about time you went oﬀ home sir?
- I’m trying to baby, I’m trying to, - is what Ford invariably replied on these
occasions.
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into
the night sky was any kind of ﬂying saucer at all. The reason he said green was
that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.
Ford Prefect was desperate that any ﬂying saucer at all would arrive soon
because ﬁfteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly
somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.
Ford wished that a ﬂying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how
to ﬂag ﬂying saucers down and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the
Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day."

By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-
descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended
from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse
and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.
This friend of his had ﬁrst arrived on the planet some ﬁfteen Earth years
previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society - with,
it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those ﬁfteen years
pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit
on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to
choose the name ”Ford Prefect” as being nicely inconspicuous.
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicu-
ously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from
the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There
was something very slightly odd about him, but it was diﬃcult to say what
it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn’t blink often enough and when you
talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on
his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people
the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but
a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he
would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun
of any astrophysicist he could ﬁnd till he got thrown out.
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into
the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he
would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.
- Oh, just looking for ﬂying saucers, - he would joke and everyone would
laugh and ask him what sort of ﬂying saucers he was looking for.
- Green ones! - he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment
and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of
drinks.
Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on
whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases
that honestly the colour of the ﬂying saucers didn’t matter that much really.
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often
ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would
usually say something like:
- Don’t you think it’s about time you went oﬀ home sir?
- I’m trying to baby, I’m trying to, - is what Ford invariably replied on these
occasions.
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into
the night sky was any kind of ﬂying saucer at all. The reason he said green was
that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.
Ford Prefect was desperate that any ﬂying saucer at all would arrive soon
because ﬁfteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly
somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.
Ford wished that a ﬂying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how
to ﬂag ﬂying saucers down and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the
Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day."

In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of
Arthur’s house had settled into a steady routine. It was Arthur’s accepted role
to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his
mother or a good book; it was Mr. Prosser’s accepted role to tackle Arthur
with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March
of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never
Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bull-
dozer drivers accepted role to sit around drinking coﬀee and experimenting with
union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their ﬁnancial ad-
vantage.
The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.
The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.
A shadow moved across him again.
- Hello Arthur, - said the shadow.
Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect
standing above him.
- Ford! Hello, how are you?
- Fine, - said Ford, - look, are you busy?
- Am I busy? - exclaimed Arthur. - Well, I’ve just got all these bulldozers
and things to lie in front of because they’ll knock my house down if I don’t, but
other than that... well, no not especially, why?
They don’t have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to
notice it unless he was concentrating. He said,
- Good, is there anywhere we can talk?
- What? - said Arthur Dent.
For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared ﬁxedly into the sky
like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then suddenly he squatted down
beside Arthur.
- We’ve got to talk, - he said urgently.
- Fine, - said Arthur, - talk.
- And drink, - said Ford. - It’s vitally important that we talk and drink.
Now. We’ll go to the pub in the village.
He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.
- Look, don’t you understand? - shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. -
That man wants to knock my house down!
Ford glanced at him, puzzled.
- Well he can do it while you’re away can’t he? - he asked.
- But I don’t want him to!
- Ah.
- Look, what’s the matter with you Ford? - said Arthur.
- Nothing. Nothing’s the matter. Listen to me - I’ve got to tell you the most
important thing you’ve ever heard. I’ve got to tell you now, and I’ve got to tell
you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom.
- But why?
- Because you are going to need a very stiﬀ drink.
Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to ﬁnd that his will was
beginning to weaken. He didn’t realize that this was because of an old drink-"

That man wants to knock my house down!
Ford glanced at him, puzzled.
- Well he can do it while you’re away can’t he? - he asked.
- But I don’t want him to!
- Ah.
- Look, what’s the matter with you Ford? - said Arthur.
- Nothing. Nothing’s the matter. Listen to me - I’ve got to tell you the most
important thing you’ve ever heard. I’ve got to tell you now, and I’ve got to tell
you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom.
- But why?
- Because you are going to need a very stiﬀ drink.

madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was
played like this:
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each
of them.
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in
that ancient Orion mining song:
Oh don’t give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
No, don’t you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
For my head will ﬂy, my tongue will lie,
my eyes will fry and I may die
Won’t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit”).
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle
and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent - who would
then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be reﬁlled. The game would be played again. And
again.
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the
eﬀects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power.
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the ﬁnal loser
would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.
Ford Prefect usually played to lose.
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go

shouted.

how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He was surprised and
slightly alarmed to ﬁnd that Arthur had company.

Ford Prefect usually played to lose.
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go
to the Horse and Groom after all.
- But what about my house?.. - he asked plaintively.
Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck
him.
- He wants to knock your house down?
- Yes, he wants to build...
- And he can’t because you’re lying in front of the bulldozers?
- Yes, and...
- I’m sure we can come to some arrangement, - said Ford. - Excuse me! he
shouted.
Mr. Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers
about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and
how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He was surprised and
slightly alarmed to ﬁnd that Arthur had company.
- Yes? Hello? - he called. - Has Mr. Dent come to his senses yet?
- Can we for the moment, - called Ford, - assume that he hasn’t?
- Well? - sighed Mr. Prosser.
- And can we also assume, - said Ford, - that he’s going to be staying here
all day?
- So?
- So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?
- Could be, could be...
- Well, if you’re resigned to doing that anyway, you don’t actually need him
to lie here all the time do you?
- What?
- You don’t, - said Ford patiently, - actually need him here."

ing game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the
madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was
played like this:
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each
of them.
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in
that ancient Orion mining song:
Oh don’t give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
No, don’t you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
For my head will ﬂy, my tongue will lie,
my eyes will fry and I may die
Won’t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit”).
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle
and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent - who would
then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be reﬁlled. The game would be played again. And
again.

Mr. Prosser thought about this.
- Well no, not as such... - he said, - not exactly need... - Prosser was worried.
He thought that one of them wasn’t making a lot of sense.
Ford said,
- So if you would just like to take it as read that he’s actually here, then he
and I could slip oﬀ down to the pub for half an hour. How does that sound?
Mr. Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.
- That sounds perfectly reasonable, - he said in a reassuring tone of voice,
wondering who he was trying to reassure.
- And if you want to pop oﬀ for a quick one yourself later on, - said Ford, -
we can always cover up for you in return.
- Thank you very much, - said Mr. Prosser who no longer knew how to play
this at all, - thank you very much, yes, that’s very kind... - He frowned, then
smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and
rolled it ﬁtfully round the top of his head. He could only assume that he had
just won.
- So, - continued Ford Prefect, - if you would just like to come over here and
lie down...
- What? - said Mr. Prosser.
- Ah, I’m sorry, - said Ford, - perhaps I hadn’t made myself fully clear.
Somebody’s got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven’t they? Or there won’t
be anything to stop them driving into Mr. Dent’s house will there?
- What? - said Mr. Prosser again.
- It’s very simple, - said Ford, - my client, Mr. Dent, says that he will stop
lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and take over from
him.
- What are you talking about? - said Arthur, but Ford nudged him with his
shoe to be quiet.
- You want me, - said Mr. Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself,
- to come and lie there...
- Yes.
- In front of the bulldozer?
- Yes.
- Instead of Mr. Dent.
- Yes.
- In the mud.
- In, as you say it, the mud.
As soon as Mr. Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all,
it was as if a weight lifted itself oﬀ his shoulders: this was more like the world
as he knew it. He sighed.
- In return for which you will take Mr. Dent with you down to the pub?
- That’s it, - said Ford. - That’s it exactly.
Mr. Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped.
- Promise?
- Promise, - said Ford. He turned to Arthur.
- Come on, - he said to him, - get up and let the man lie down.
Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.
Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud. He
felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered"

Here’s what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that
alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and
also notes its intoxicating eﬀect on certain carbon-based life forms.
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that
the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.
It says that the eﬀect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your
brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle
Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary
organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards.
The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.
Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol’ Janx Spirit, it says.
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V - Oh that
Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean ﬁsh!!!
Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must
be properly iced or the benzine is lost).
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all
those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.
Over the back of a silver spoon ﬂoat a measure of Qualactin Hypermint
extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle
sweet and mystic.
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the
ﬁres of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.
Sprinkle Zamphuor.
Add an olive.
Drink... but... very carefully...
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclo-
pedia Galactica.
- Six pints of bitter, - said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and
Groom. - And quickly please, the world’s about to end.
The barman of the Horse and Groom didn’t deserve this sort of treatment,
he was a digniﬁed old man. He pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at
Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of the window, so the barman
looked instead at Arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing.
So the barman said,
- Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it, - and started pulling pints.

The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit.

Arthur stared into his beer.

like this and I’ve been too wrapped up in myself to notice?
- Alright, - said Ford, - I’ll try to explain. How long have we known each
other?
- How long? - Arthur thought. - Er, about ﬁve years, maybe six, - he said.
- Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time.

Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betel-

- Arsenal without a chance?

A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the
six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked

On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the iono-
sphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact,
several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as oﬃce buildings,
silent as birds. They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the
star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.
The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence,
which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The huge yellow somethings
went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip,
Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them - which was a pity
because it was exactly the sort of thing they’d been looking for all these years.
The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself. It nestled in the
darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore habitually round his
neck. The contents of Ford Prefect’s satchel were quite interesting in fact and
would have made any Earth physicist’s eyes pop out of his head, which is why
he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays
he pretended he was auditioning for stuﬀed in the top. Besides the Sub-Etha
Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb - a short squat black
rod, smooth and matt with a couple of ﬂat switches and dials at one end; he also
had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator. This had
about a hundred tiny ﬂat press buttons and a screen about four inches square
on which any one of a million ”pages” could be summoned at a moment’s notice.
It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug
plastic cover it ﬁtted into had the words Don’t Panic printed on it in large
friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that most
remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations
of Ursa Minor - The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it
was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if
it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require
several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in.
Beneath that in Ford Prefect’s satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a
largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject
of towels.
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch
hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you

it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady
sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on
the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy
river Moth; wet it for use in hand-tohand-combat; wrap it round your head to
ward oﬀ noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast
of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it
can’t see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in
emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself oﬀ with it if it still
seems to be clean enough.
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some rea-
son, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel
with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a tooth-
brush, face ﬂannel, soap, tin of biscuits, ﬂask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat
spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then
happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch
hiker might accidentally have ”lost”. What the strag will think is that any man
who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle
against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly
a man to be reckoned with.
Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in
- Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There’s a frood who really knows
where his towel is.
(Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy;
frood: really amazingly together guy.)
Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect’s satchel, the Sub-Etha
Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the surface of the planet
the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided
it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea.
- You got a towel with you? - said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.
Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.
- Why? What, no... should I have? - He had given up being surprised, there
didn’t seem to be any point any longer.
Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.
- Drink up, - he urged.
At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside ﬁltered
through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through
the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had even-
tually bought him.
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.
- What’s that? - he yelped.
- Don’t worry, - said Ford, - they haven’t started yet.
- Thank God for that, - said Arthur and relaxed.
- It’s probably just your house being knocked down, - said Ford, drowning

sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on
the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy
river Moth; wet it for use in hand-tohand-combat; wrap it round your head to
ward oﬀ noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast
of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it
can’t see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in
emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself oﬀ with it if it still
seems to be clean enough.
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some rea-
son, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel
with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a tooth-
brush, face ﬂannel, soap, tin of biscuits, ﬂask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat
spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then
happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch
hiker might accidentally have ”lost”. What the strag will think is that any man
who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle
against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly
a man to be reckoned with.
Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in
- Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There’s a frood who really knows
where his towel is.

At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside ﬁltered

- Fun? - yelped Arthur. - Fun! - He quickly checked out of the window again
that they were talking about the same thing.
- Damn their fun! - he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a
nearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime.
- Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers! - bawled Arthur. - You half crazed
Visigoths, stop will you!
Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he asked
for four packets of peanuts.
- There you are sir, - said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, -
twenty-eight pence if you’d be so kind.
Ford was very kind - he gave the barman another ﬁve-pound note and told
him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford.
He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn’t
understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments
of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This
signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that
being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be further
than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn’t very far,
so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment
under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of
Betelgeuse.
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense
of distance. He didn’t know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with
a new sense of respect, almost awe.
- Are you serious, sir? - he said in a small whisper which had the eﬀect of
silencing the pub. - You think the world’s going to end?
- Yes, - said Ford.
- But, this afternoon?
Ford had recovered himself. He was at his ﬂippest.
- Yes, - he said gaily, - in less than two minutes I would estimate.
The barman couldn’t believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn’t
believe the sensation he had just had either.
- Isn’t there anything we can do about it then? - he said.
- No, nothing, - said Ford, stuﬃng the peanuts into his pockets.
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid ev-
eryone had become.
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes waved their
way up to Ford.
- I thought, - he said, - that if the world was going to end we were meant to
lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.
- If you like, yes, - said Ford.
- That’s what they told us in the army, - said the man, and his eyes began
the long trek back down to his whisky.
- Will that help? - asked the barman.
- No, - said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. - Excuse me, - he said, -
I’ve got to go. - With a wave, he left.
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough,
the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along

for four packets of peanuts.
- There you are sir, - said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, -
twenty-eight pence if you’d be so kind.
Ford was very kind - he gave the barman another ﬁve-pound note and told
him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford.
He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn’t
understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments
of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This
signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that
being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be further
than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn’t very far,
so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment
under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of
Betelgeuse.
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense
of distance. He didn’t know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with
a new sense of respect, almost awe.
- Are you serious, sir? - he said in a small whisper which had the eﬀect of
silencing the pub. - You think the world’s going to end?
- Yes, - said Ford.
- But, this afternoon?
Ford had recovered himself. He was at his ﬂippest.
- Yes, - he said gaily, - in less than two minutes I would estimate.
The barman couldn’t believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn’t
believe the sensation he had just had either.
- Isn’t there anything we can do about it then? - he said.
- No, nothing, - said Ford, stuﬃng the peanuts into his pockets.
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid ev-
eryone had become.
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes waved their
way up to Ford.
- I thought, - he said, - that if the world was going to end we were meant to
lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.
- If you like, yes, - said Ford.
- That’s what they told us in the army, - said the man, and his eyes began
the long trek back down to his whisky.
- Will that help? - asked the barman.
- No, - said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. - Excuse me, - he said, -
I’ve got to go. - With a wave, he left.
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough,
the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along
to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or so,
and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a"

that they were talking about the same thing.
- Damn their fun! - he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a
nearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime.

Visigoths, stop will you!

minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiﬀ of hydrogen,
ozone and carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be
too busy evaporating herself to notice it.
The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say:
- Last orders, please.
The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster.
Ford knew they were there. This wasn’t the way he had wanted it.
Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He didn’t notice
how cold it had suddenly become, he didn’t notice the wind, he didn’t notice the
sudden irrational squall of rain. He didn’t notice anything but the caterpillar
bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home.
- You barbarians! - he yelled. - I’ll sue the council for every penny it’s got!
I’ll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And whipped! And boiled... until...
until... until you’ve had enough.
Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast.
- And then I’ll do it again! - yelled Arthur. - And when I’ve ﬁnished I will
take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!
Arthur didn’t notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he
didn’t notice that Mr. Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. What Mr.
Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through
the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings.
- And I will carry on jumping on them, - yelled Arthur, still running, - until
I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then...
Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed ﬂat on his back. At last
he noticed that something was going on. His ﬁnger shot upwards.
- What the hell’s that? - he shrieked.
Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky
apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt oﬀ into the distance leaving the
gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your
skull.
Another one followed and did the same thing only louder.
It’s diﬃcult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were
doing now, because they didn’t really know what they were doing themselves.
None of it made a lot of sense - running into houses, running out of houses,
howling noiselessly at the noise. All around the world city streets exploded
with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then
rolled oﬀ like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to
ﬂatten everything it hit.
Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in
his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly what was happening
and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-OMatic had started winking in
the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start. It was what he
had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern
sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed
his heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a
big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn’t it just have to be the Vogons.
Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed through the
air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw away a copy of Joseph and
the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: He"
162,What was the message delivered by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council to the people of Earth?,"25
wouldn’t need them where he was going. Everything was ready, everything was
prepared.
He knew where his towel was.
A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the noise. For
a while nothing happened.
The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth.
Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against
nature. Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass
what they were looking at. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way
that bricks don’t.
And still nothing happened.
Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient
sound. Every hi ﬁ set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette
recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world quietly
turned itself on.
Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass,
every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding
board.
Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate
in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built. But there
was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message.
- People of Earth, your attention please, - a voice said, and it was wonderful.
Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make
a brave man weep.
- This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Coun-
cil, - the voice continued. - As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for
development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hy-
perspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet
is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less that
two of your Earth minutes. Thank you.
The PA died away.
Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. The terror
moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron ﬁllings on a
sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them. Panic sprouted again,
desperate ﬂeeing panic, but there was nowhere to ﬂee to.
Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said:
- There’s no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts
and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department
on Alpha Centauri for ﬁfty of your Earth years, so you’ve had plenty of time to
lodge any formal complaint and it’s far too late to start making a fuss about it
now.
The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted oﬀ across the land. The huge
ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the underside of each a
hatchway opened, an empty black space.
By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter,
located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to
plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard what they said, they only
heard the reply. The PA slammed back into life again. The voice was annoyed.
It said:"

- What do you mean you’ve never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven’s
sake mankind, it’s only four light years away you know. I’m sorry, but if you

Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, ﬁve hundred thousand light

Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking
and ﬂashing in the Damogran sun.

Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.
The boat sped on across the water. It would be some time before it reached
its destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet. It
consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty
but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean.
The boat sped on.
Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always remained a
deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran
for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold
was so secret.

main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet.
Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island

to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination

No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.
Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which
the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had
announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli:
he was the ideal Presidency fodder
President : full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government. The
term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor
is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. In the last moments of his
dying coma he was locked in a statis ﬁeld which keeps him in a state of perpetual
unchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without
any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and eﬀectively moved a rung or
two down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act
simply as advisers to the Emperor - an elected Governmental assembly headed
by a President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such place.
The President in particular is very much a ﬁgurehead - he wields no real
power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities
he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of ﬁnely judged
outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always
an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to
draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the
most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent two
of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize
that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of
these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded.
Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is
handled by a computer. They couldn’t be more wrong.¿
What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it.
He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.
Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod
had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox’s Presidency was all
about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another
meaningless coincidence.
As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to
himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and
spread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He steered with an extra arm
he’d recently ﬁtted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.
- Hey, - he cooed to himself, - you’re a real cool boy you. - But his nerves
sang a song shriller than a dog whistle.
The island of France was about twenty miles long, ﬁve miles across the
middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not so much as
an island in its own right as simply a means of deﬁning the sweep and curve of
a huge bay. This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline
of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliﬀs. From the top of the cliﬀ
the land sloped slowly down ﬁve miles to the opposite shore.

Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which
the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had
announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli:
he was the ideal Presidency fodder
President : full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government. The
term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor
is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. In the last moments of his
dying coma he was locked in a statis ﬁeld which keeps him in a state of perpetual
unchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without
any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and eﬀectively moved a rung or
two down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act
simply as advisers to the Emperor - an elected Governmental assembly headed
by a President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such place.
The President in particular is very much a ﬁgurehead - he wields no real
power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities
he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of ﬁnely judged
outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always
an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to
draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the
most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent two
of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize
that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of
these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded.
Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is
handled by a computer. They couldn’t be more wrong.¿

Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod
had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox’s Presidency was all
about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another
meaningless coincidence.
As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to
himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and

There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them. To-

physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted
and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest ex-
citement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck.
(An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It
might not even have made much diﬀerence to them if they’d known exactly how
much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six
people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to
wield power but to attract attention away from it.
Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.
The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the Presidential speed-
boat zipped round the headland into the bay. It ﬂashed and shone as it came
skating over the sea in wide skidding turns.
In fact it didn’t need to touch the water at all, because it was supported
on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms - but just for eﬀect it was ﬁtted with thin
ﬁnblades which could be lowered into the water. They slashed sheets of water
hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and
sank back foaming into the boat’s wake as it careered across the bay.
Zaphod loved eﬀect: it was what he was best at.
He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid
beneath the cliﬀ face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves.
Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over
three billion people. The three billion people weren’t actually there, but they
watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which
hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made
amazingly popular tri-D; that’s what they were for.
He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn’t know it, but today
would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.
The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two
heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance except
for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair stuck out in random
directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentiﬁable, and
his chins were almost always unshaven.
A twenty-foot-high transparent globe ﬂoated next to his boat, rolling and
bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it ﬂoated a wide semi-circular
sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled,
the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again,
all done for eﬀect as much as anything.
Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He
spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some
dust oﬀ his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up. At any
moment, he thought, he might scream.
Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble
surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, up it climbed,
throwing stilts of light at the cliﬀ. Up it surged on the jet, the water falling
from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.
Zaphod smiled, picturing himself."

Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He
spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some
dust oﬀ his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up. At any
moment, he thought, he might scream.
Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble
surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, up it climbed,
throwing stilts of light at the cliﬀ. Up it surged on the jet, the water falling
from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.
Zaphod smiled, picturing himself."

There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them. To-
gether and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of
physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted
and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest ex-
citement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck.
(An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It
might not even have made much diﬀerence to them if they’d known exactly how
much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six
people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to
wield power but to attract attention away from it.
Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.
The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the Presidential speed-
boat zipped round the headland into the bay. It ﬂashed and shone as it came
skating over the sea in wide skidding turns.
In fact it didn’t need to touch the water at all, because it was supported
on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms - but just for eﬀect it was ﬁtted with thin
ﬁnblades which could be lowered into the water. They slashed sheets of water
hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and
sank back foaming into the boat’s wake as it careered across the bay.
Zaphod loved eﬀect: it was what he was best at.
He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid
beneath the cliﬀ face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves.
Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over
three billion people. The three billion people weren’t actually there, but they
watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which
hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made
amazingly popular tri-D; that’s what they were for.
He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn’t know it, but today
would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.
The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two
heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance except
for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair stuck out in random
directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentiﬁable, and
his chins were almost always unshaven.
A twenty-foot-high transparent globe ﬂoated next to his boat, rolling and
bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it ﬂoated a wide semi-circular
sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled,
the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again,
all done for eﬀect as much as anything.

192,"What form of transport did Zaphod Beeblebrox arrive in, and how did he make his grand entrance at the top of the cliff?","30 CHAPTER 4.
A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one.
At the top of the cliﬀ the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed
ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt.
To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his
orange sash blazing in the light.
The President of the Galaxy had arrived.
He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in greeting.
- Hi, - he said.
A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his
prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of the original version were
at the moment ﬂoating soggily on the Damogran sea some ﬁve miles out from
the bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested
Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of
nest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of papier m@ch@
and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of
it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of
the species but wanted no truck with it.
Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently de-
ﬂected the one being oﬀered him by the spider.
- Hi, - he said again.
Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled out
Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had picked up recently
whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid,
with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and
ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular
way and her long ﬂowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not
that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab of course. The Arabs had very
recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were ﬁve hundred
thousand light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn’t anybody in particular, or
so Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot and told him
what she thought of him.
- Hi honey, - he said to her.
She ﬂashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she looked back
for a moment and smiled more warmly - but by this time he was looking at
something else.
- Hi, - he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing
nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes. He
grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would
be giving them one hell of a quote.
The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of the
oﬃcials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in
a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him,
and had ﬂipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away
in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down
in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone

they had built it that way.

207,Describe the physical appearance of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz and explain how it reflects the evolutionary history of the Vogons.,"Chapter 5
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons. His
highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green
rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service
politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indeﬁnitely
at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill eﬀects.
Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule would not
allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons
had ﬁrst crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain
panting and heaving on the planet’s virgin shores... when the ﬁrst rays of the
bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the
forces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside
in disgust and written them oﬀ as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. They never
evolved again; they should never have survived.
The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed slug-brained
stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution? - they said to themselves, - Who
needs it?, - and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without
until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences
with surgery.
Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working
overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought forth scintillating
jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron
mallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the
Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazellelike creatures
with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They
were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the
Vogons sat on them anyway.
Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the
Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel. Within a few
short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the
political hub of the Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of
the Galactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning, they have
attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern
Vogon is little diﬀerent from his primitive forebears. Every year they import
twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native
planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron
mallets.

Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic
Vogon Jeltz’s ﬂagship, a small match ﬂared nervously. The owner of the match
was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His
name was Ford Prefect.
Ford Prefect’s original name is only pronuncible in an obscure Betelgeusian
dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal.
/Sid./ Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betel-
geuse Seven. Ford’s father was the only man on the entire planet to survive
the Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he
was never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep
mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to
collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford’s father, magnanimously waving
aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to
live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of
his now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue.
Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually
died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy. The
other kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five
translates as ”boy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor
why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven”¿.
He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shad-
ows loomed and leaped with the tiny ﬂickering ﬂame, but all was quiet. He
breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly
tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently
taken to employing as catering staﬀ on their long haul ﬂeets, on the strict un-
derstanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves.
This suited the Dentrassis ﬁne, because they loved Vogon money, which is
one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The
only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon.
It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not
now a whiﬀ of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.

ﬂoor. The shape moved again.
Ford Prefect said:

the Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he
was never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep
mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to
collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford’s father, magnanimously waving
aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to
live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of
his now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue.
Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually
died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy. The
other kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five
translates as ”boy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor
why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven”¿.
He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shad-
ows loomed and leaped with the tiny ﬂickering ﬂame, but all was quiet. He
breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly
tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently
taken to employing as catering staﬀ on their long haul ﬂeets, on the strict un-
derstanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves.
This suited the Dentrassis ﬁne, because they loved Vogon money, which is
one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The
only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon.
It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not
now a whiﬀ of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.
He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape
moving slightly on the ﬂoor. Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his
pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. He crouched on the
ﬂoor. The shape moved again.
Ford Prefect said:
- I bought some peanuts.
Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.
- Here, have some, - urged Ford, shaking the packet again, - if you’ve never
been through a matter transference beam before you’ve probably lost some salt
and protein. The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit.
- Whhhrrrr... - said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes.
- It’s dark, - he said.
- Yes, - said Ford Prefect, - it’s dark.
- No light, - said Arthur Dent. - Dark, no light.
One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about
human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious,

vile. Also, he did not like hitch hikers.
Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic
Vogon Jeltz’s ﬂagship, a small match ﬂared nervously. The owner of the match
was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His
name was Ford Prefect.
Ford Prefect’s original name is only pronuncible in an obscure Betelgeusian
dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal.

217,What theory did the character initially have about why human beings need to keep exercising their lips?,"35
for this strange behaviour. If human beings don’t keep exercising their lips, he
thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months’ consideration and
observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don’t keep
on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he
abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite
liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about
the terrible number of things they didn’t know about.
- Yes, - he agreed with Arthur, - no light. - He helped Arthur to some
peanuts. - How do you feel? - he asked.
- Like a military academy, - said Arthur, - bits of me keep on passing out.
Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness.
- If I asked you where the hell we were, - said Arthur weakly, - would I regret
it?
Ford stood up.
- We’re safe, - he said.
- Oh good, - said Arthur.
- We’re in a small galley cabin, - said Ford, - in one of the spaceships of the
Vogon Constructor Fleet.
- Ah, - said Arthur, - this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe
that I wasn’t previously aware of.
Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous
shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged
himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the
air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying
themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.
- How did we get here? - he asked, shivering slightly.
- We hitched a lift, - said Ford.
- Excuse me? - said Arthur. - Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck
out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said,
Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout?
- Well, - said Ford, - the Thumb’s an electronic sub-etha signalling device,
the roundabout’s at Barnard’s Star six light years away, but otherwise, that’s
more or less right.
- And the bug-eyed monster?
- Is green, yes.
- Fine, - said Arthur, - when can I get home?
- You can’t, - said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch.
- Shade your eyes... - he said, and turned it on.
Even Ford was surprised.
- Good grief, - said Arthur, - is this really the interior of a ﬂying saucer?
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control
bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He
wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he
could shout at them and feel better. He ﬂopped as heavily as he could on to
his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be
genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak.

at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved. He
was glad it wouldn’t now be him who delivered the report they’d just received.

Even Ford was surprised.
- Good grief, - said Arthur, - is this really the interior of a ﬂying saucer?
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control
bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He
wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he
could shout at them and feel better. He ﬂopped as heavily as he could on to
his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be
genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak.
- Go away! - he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge
at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved. He
was glad it wouldn’t now be him who delivered the report they’d just received.
The report was an oﬃcial release which said that a wonderful new form of"

for this strange behaviour. If human beings don’t keep exercising their lips, he
thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months’ consideration and
observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don’t keep
on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he
abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite
liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about
the terrible number of things they didn’t know about.
- Yes, - he agreed with Arthur, - no light. - He helped Arthur to some
peanuts. - How do you feel? - he asked.
- Like a military academy, - said Arthur, - bits of me keep on passing out.
Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness.
- If I asked you where the hell we were, - said Arthur weakly, - would I regret
it?
Ford stood up.
- We’re safe, - he said.
- Oh good, - said Arthur.
- We’re in a small galley cabin, - said Ford, - in one of the spaceships of the
Vogon Constructor Fleet.
- Ah, - said Arthur, - this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe
that I wasn’t previously aware of.
Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous
shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged
himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the
air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying
themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.
- How did we get here? - he asked, shivering slightly.
- We hitched a lift, - said Ford.
- Excuse me? - said Arthur. - Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck
out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said,
Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout?
- Well, - said Ford, - the Thumb’s an electronic sub-etha signalling device,
the roundabout’s at Barnard’s Star six light years away, but otherwise, that’s
more or less right.
- And the bug-eyed monster?
- Is green, yes.

unnecessary.
Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn’t shout because
it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals.
A meal would be most welcome.
A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray. It was
grinning like a maniac.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a Dentrassi looked
that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship
that he could get very angry indeed about.
Ford and Arthur stared about them.
- Well, what do you think? - said Ford.
- It’s a bit squalid, isn’t it?
Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidentiﬁable bits
of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin.
- Well, this is a working ship, you see, - said Ford. - These are the Dentrassi
sleeping quarters.
- I thought you said they were called Vogons or something.
- Yes, - said Ford, - the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks,
they let us on board.
- I’m confused, - said Arthur.
- Here, have a look at this, - said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses
and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and
then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because
all mattresses grown in the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly
killed and dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to life
again.
Ford handed the book to Arthur.
- What is it? - asked Arthur.
- The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. It’s a sort of electronic book. It
tells you everything you need to know about anything. That’s its job.
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands.
- I like the cover, - he said. - Don’t Panic. It’s the ﬁrst helpful or intelligible
thing anybody’s said to me all day.
- I’ll show you how it works, - said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur who
was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its
cover.
- You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving you the
index.
A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to ﬂicker
across the surface.
- You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so. - His ﬁngers
tapped some more keys. - And there we are.
The words Vogon Constructor Fleets ﬂared in green across the screen.
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began
to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as
well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what the book said.

The words Vogon Constructor Fleets ﬂared in green across the screen.
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began
to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as
well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what the book said.

235,What is the role of the Dentrassis on the spaceship?,"36 CHAPTER 5.
spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research
base on Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes
unnecessary.
Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn’t shout because
it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals.
A meal would be most welcome.
A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray. It was
grinning like a maniac.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a Dentrassi looked
that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship
that he could get very angry indeed about.
Ford and Arthur stared about them.
- Well, what do you think? - said Ford.
- It’s a bit squalid, isn’t it?
Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidentiﬁable bits
of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin.
- Well, this is a working ship, you see, - said Ford. - These are the Dentrassi
sleeping quarters.
- I thought you said they were called Vogons or something.
- Yes, - said Ford, - the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks,
they let us on board.
- I’m confused, - said Arthur.
- Here, have a look at this, - said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses
and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and
then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because
all mattresses grown in the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly
killed and dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to life
again.
Ford handed the book to Arthur.
- What is it? - asked Arthur.
- The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. It’s a sort of electronic book. It
tells you everything you need to know about anything. That’s its job.
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands.
- I like the cover, - he said. - Don’t Panic. It’s the ﬁrst helpful or intelligible
thing anybody’s said to me all day.
- I’ll show you how it works, - said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur who
was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its
cover.

not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, oﬃcious and callous. They
wouldn’t even lift a ﬁnger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous
Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back,
queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and ﬁnally buried
in soft peat and recycled as ﬁrelighters.
- The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your ﬁnger down
his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the
Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
- On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you.
Arthur blinked at it.
- What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?
- That’s the point, it’s out of date now, - said Ford, sliding the book back
into its cover. - I’m doing the ﬁeld research for the New Revised Edition, and
one of the things I’ll have to include is a bit about how the Vogons now employ
Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole.
A pained expression crossed Arthur’s face.
- But who are the Dentrassi? - he said.
- Great guys, - said Ford. - They’re the best cooks and the best drink mixers
and they don’t give a wet slap about anything else. And they’ll always help
hitch hikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but mostly because
it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if
you’re an impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for
less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day. And that’s my job. Fun, isn’t it?
Arthur looked lost.
- It’s amazing, - he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses.
- Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended,
- said Ford. - I came for a week and got stuck for ﬁfteen years.
- But how did you get there in the ﬁrst place then?
- Easy, I got a lift with a teaser.
- A teaser?
- Yeah.
- Er, what is...
- A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise
around looking for planets which haven’t made interstellar contact yet and buzz
them.
- Buzz them? - Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life
diﬃcult for him.
- Yeah, - said Ford, - they buzz them. They ﬁnd some isolated spot with very
few people around, then land right by some poor soul whom no one’s ever going
to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on
their heads and making beep beep noises. Rather childish really. - Ford leant
back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly
pleased with himself.
- Ford, - insisted Arthur, - I don’t know if this sounds like a silly question,
but what am I doing here?
- Well you know that, - said Ford. - I rescued you from the Earth.

few people around, then land right by some poor soul whom no one’s ever going
to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on
their heads and making beep beep noises. Rather childish really. - Ford leant
back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly
pleased with himself.
- Ford, - insisted Arthur, - I don’t know if this sounds like a silly question,
but what am I doing here?
- Well you know that, - said Ford. - I rescued you from the Earth.
- And what’s happened to the Earth?

- The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your ﬁnger down
his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the
Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
- On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you.
Arthur blinked at it.
- What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?
- That’s the point, it’s out of date now, - said Ford, sliding the book back
into its cover. - I’m doing the ﬁeld research for the New Revised Edition, and
one of the things I’ll have to include is a bit about how the Vogons now employ
Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole.
A pained expression crossed Arthur’s face.
- But who are the Dentrassi? - he said.
- Great guys, - said Ford. - They’re the best cooks and the best drink mixers
and they don’t give a wet slap about anything else. And they’ll always help
hitch hikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but mostly because
it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if
you’re an impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for
less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day. And that’s my job. Fun, isn’t it?
Arthur looked lost.
- It’s amazing, - he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses.
- Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended,
- said Ford. - I came for a week and got stuck for ﬁfteen years.
- But how did you get there in the ﬁrst place then?
- Easy, I got a lift with a teaser.
- A teaser?
- Yeah.
- Er, what is...
- A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise
around looking for planets which haven’t made interstellar contact yet and buzz
them.
- Buzz them? - Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life

Ford sprang up.
- Keep looking at the book! - he hissed urgently.
- What?
- Don’t Panic.
- I’m not panicking!
- Yes you are.
- Alright so I’m panicking, what else is there to do?
- You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy’s a fun
place. You’ll need to have this ﬁsh in your ear.
- I beg your pardon? - asked Arthur, rather politely he thought.
Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow
ﬁsh wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him. He wished there was some-
thing simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of. He would have felt safe if
alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and
the man from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow ﬁsh and oﬀering to put it in
his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of corn ﬂakes. He couldn’t,
and he didn’t feel safe.
Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify.
He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst ﬁghting
oﬀ a pack of wolves.
- Shush! - said Ford. - Listen, it might be important.
- Im... important?
- It’s the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T’annoy.
- You mean that’s how the Vogons talk?
- Listen!
- But I can’t speak Vogon!
- You don’t need to. Just put that ﬁsh in your ear.
Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur’s ear, and he
had the sudden sickening sensation of the ﬁsh slithering deep into his aural tract.
Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly
turned goggle-eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent of
looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a
picture of a white candlestick. Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece
of paper which suddenly resolve themselves into the ﬁgure six and mean that
your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of glasses.
He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only now it had
taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward English.

it totally clear that you are not at all welcome. I worked hard to get where I
am today, and I didn’t become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I
could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent
out a search party, and as soon that they ﬁnd you I will put you oﬀ the ship. If
you’re very lucky I might read you some of my poetry ﬁrst.
- Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to Barnard’s

to leave the ship during that time. I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled. I’ve
just had an unhappy love aﬀair, so I don’t see why anybody else should have a

Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a
small ball on the ﬂoor with his arms wrapped round his head. He smiled weakly.
- Charming man, - he said. - I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her
to marry one...
- You wouldn’t need to, said Ford. - They’ve got as much sex appeal as a
road accident. No, don’t move, - he added as Arthur began to uncurl himself,
- you’d better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It’s unpleasantly like
being drunk.
- What’s so unpleasant about being drunk?
- You ask a glass of water.
Arthur thought about this.
- Ford, - he said.
- Yeah?
- What’s this ﬁsh doing in my ear?
- It’s translating for you. It’s a Babel ﬁsh. Look it up in the book if you

He tossed over The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and then curled
himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump.
At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur’s mind.
His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head.

262,What is the Babel fish and how does it function according to The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy?,"40 CHAPTER 6.
The room folded ﬂat about him, spun around, shifted out of existence and
left him sliding into his own navel.
They were passing through hyperspace.
- The Babel ﬁsh, said The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy quietly, - is
small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It
feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from those around it. It
absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nour-
ish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix
formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked
up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical
upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel ﬁsh in your ear you can instantly
understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns
you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your
mind by your Babel ﬁsh.
- Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-
boggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have
chosen to see it as the ﬁnal and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.
The argument goes something like this:
- I refuse to prove that I exist, - says God, - for proof denies faith, and
without faith I am nothing.
- But, - says Man, - The Babel ﬁsh is a dead giveaway, isn’t it? It could
not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own
arguments, you don’t. QED.
- Oh dear, - says God, - I hadn’t thought of that, - and promptly vanished
in a puﬀ of logic.
- Oh, that was easy, - says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that
black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.
- Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo’s
kidneys, but that didn’t stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he
used it as the central theme of his bestselling book Well That About Wraps It
Up For God.
- Meanwhile, the poor Babel ﬁsh, by eﬀectively removing all barriers to com-
munication between diﬀerent races and cultures, has caused more and bloddier
wars than anything else in the history of creation.
Arthur let out a low groan. He was horriﬁed to discover that the kick through
hyperspace hadn’t killed him. He was now six light years from the place that
the Earth would have been if it still existed.
The Earth.
Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no
way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it
was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister
had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to.
No reaction. Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing
behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden stab - the
supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson’s Column had gone!
Nelson’s Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was
no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson’s Column only existed in
his mind. England only existed in his mind - his mind, stuck here in this dank
smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him."

again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn’t grasp it. He decided to start
smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He’d never seriously believed
it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor
there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave
him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any such thing
as a McDonald’s hamburger.
He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing

much about the Earth of course.

smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He’d never seriously believed

there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave
him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any such thing

Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.
The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a recitation by
their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem ”Ode To A Small Lump
of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning” four of his
audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic
Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs oﬀ. Grunthos is
reported to have been ”disappointed” by the poem’s reception, and was about
to embark on a reading of his twelvebook epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime

cared if he had) - I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of
space, or... - he paused for melodramatic eﬀect, - tell me how good you thought
my poem was!

them. He did the smile again.

mouth and moaned.

was really particularly eﬀective.

- Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet’s compassionate soul, - Arthur felt he
was on a home stretch now, - which contrives through the medium of the verse
structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with the funda-

of his mouth: - Well done, Arthur, that was very good.

of his mouth: - Well done, Arthur, that was very good.
The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul had been
touched, but he thought no - too little too late. His voice took on the quality
of a cat snagging brushed nylon."
294,Describe Arthur's approach to dealing with the Vogon's demand for feedback on his poem.,"44 CHAPTER 7.
- Groop I implore thee, - continued the merciless Vogon, - my foonting
turlingdromes.
His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency.
- And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,— Or I will rend
thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don’t!
- Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh! - cried Ford Prefect
and threw one ﬁnal spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line caught
him full blast across the temples. He went limp.
Arthur lolled.
- Now Earthlings... - whirred the Vogon (he didn’t know that Ford Prefect
was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and wouldn’t have
cared if he had) - I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of
space, or... - he paused for melodramatic eﬀect, - tell me how good you thought
my poem was!
He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat and watched
them. He did the smile again.
Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his parched
mouth and moaned.
Arthur said brightly:
- Actually I quite liked it.
Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply not
occurred to him.
The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that eﬀectively obscured his nose and
was therefore no bad thing.
- Oh good... - he whirred, in considerable astonishment.
- Oh yes, - said Arthur, - I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery
was really particularly eﬀective.
Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts around this
totally new concept. Were they really going to be able to bareface their way
out of this?
- Yes, do continue... - invited the Vogon.
- Oh... and er... interesting rhythmic devices too, - continued Arthur, -
which seemed to counterpoint the... er... er... - He ﬂoundered.
Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding ”counterpoint the surrealism of the
underlying metaphor of the... er...” He ﬂoundered too, but Arthur was ready
again.
- ...humanity of the...
- Vogonity, - Ford hissed at him.
- Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet’s compassionate soul, - Arthur felt he
was on a home stretch now, - which contrives through the medium of the verse
structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with the funda-
mental dichotomies of the other, - (he was reaching a triumphant crescendo...)

297,What is the reason the Vogon captain gives for writing poetry?,"45
- So what you’re saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean
callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved, - he said. He paused. -
Is that right?
Ford laughed a nervous laugh.
- Well I mean yes, - he said, - don’t we all, deep down, you know... er...
The Vogon stood up.
- No, well you’re completely wrong, - he said, - I just write poetry to throw
my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief. I’m going to throw you oﬀ
the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to number three airlock and throw
them out!
- What? - shouted Ford.
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their
straps with his huge blubbery arms.
- You can’t throw us into space, - yelled Ford, - we’re trying to write a book.
- Resistance is useless! - shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It was the
ﬁrst phrase he’d learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard Corps.
The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away.
Arthur stared round him wildly.
- I don’t want to die now! - he yelled. - I’ve still got a headache! I don’t
want to go to heaven with a headache, I’d be all cross and wouldn’t enjoy it!
The guard grasped them both ﬁrmly round the neck, and bowing deferen-
tially towards his captain’s back, hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge.
A steel door closed and the captain was on his own again. He hummed quietly
and mused to himself, lightly ﬁngering his notebook of verses.
- Hmmmm, - he said, - counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor...
- He considered this for a moment, and then closed the book with a grim smile.
- Death’s too good for them, - he said.
The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two hu-
manoids clamped ﬁrmly under rubbery Vogon armpits.
- This is great, - spluttered Arthur, - this is really terriﬁc. Let go of me you
brute!
The Vogon guard dragged them on.
- Don’t you worry, - said Ford, - I’ll think of something. - He didn’t sound
hopeful.
- Resistance is useless! - bellowed the guard.
- Just don’t say things like that, - stammered Ford. - How can anyone
maintain a positive mental attitude if you’re saying things like that?
- My God, - complained Arthur, - you’re talking about a positive mental
attitude and you haven’t even had your planet demolished today. I woke up
this morning and thought I’d have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush
the dog... It’s now just after four in the afternoon and I’m already thrown out
of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth! -
He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip.
- Alright, - said Ford, - just stop panicking.
- Who said anything about panicking? - snapped Arthur. - This is still just
the culture shock. You wait till I’ve settled down into the situation and found
my bearings. Then I’ll start panicking.
- Arthur you’re getting hysterical. Shut up! - Ford tried desperately to
think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again.
- Resistance is useless!"

- This is great, - spluttered Arthur, - this is really terriﬁc. Let go of me you
brute!
The Vogon guard dragged them on.
- Don’t you worry, - said Ford, - I’ll think of something. - He didn’t sound
hopeful.
- Resistance is useless! - bellowed the guard.
- Just don’t say things like that, - stammered Ford. - How can anyone
maintain a positive mental attitude if you’re saying things like that?
- My God, - complained Arthur, - you’re talking about a positive mental
attitude and you haven’t even had your planet demolished today. I woke up
this morning and thought I’d have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush
the dog... It’s now just after four in the afternoon and I’m already thrown out
of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth! -
He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip.
- Alright, - said Ford, - just stop panicking.
- Who said anything about panicking? - snapped Arthur. - This is still just
the culture shock. You wait till I’ve settled down into the situation and found
my bearings. Then I’ll start panicking.
- Arthur you’re getting hysterical. Shut up! - Ford tried desperately to
think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again.
- Resistance is useless!"
304,How does Arthur describe his day leading up to being thrown out of the spaceship?,"45
- So what you’re saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean
callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved, - he said. He paused. -
Is that right?
Ford laughed a nervous laugh.
- Well I mean yes, - he said, - don’t we all, deep down, you know... er...
The Vogon stood up.
- No, well you’re completely wrong, - he said, - I just write poetry to throw
my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief. I’m going to throw you oﬀ
the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to number three airlock and throw
them out!
- What? - shouted Ford.
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their
straps with his huge blubbery arms.
- You can’t throw us into space, - yelled Ford, - we’re trying to write a book.
- Resistance is useless! - shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It was the
ﬁrst phrase he’d learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard Corps.
The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away.
Arthur stared round him wildly.
- I don’t want to die now! - he yelled. - I’ve still got a headache! I don’t
want to go to heaven with a headache, I’d be all cross and wouldn’t enjoy it!
The guard grasped them both ﬁrmly round the neck, and bowing deferen-
tially towards his captain’s back, hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge.
A steel door closed and the captain was on his own again. He hummed quietly
and mused to himself, lightly ﬁngering his notebook of verses.
- Hmmmm, - he said, - counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor...
- He considered this for a moment, and then closed the book with a grim smile.
- Death’s too good for them, - he said.

307,What does Ford ask the Vogon guard about his enjoyment of his job?,"46 CHAPTER 7.
- And you can shut up as well! - snapped Ford.
- Resistance is useless!
- Oh give it a rest, - said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking
straight up into his captor’s face. A thought struck him.
- Do you really enjoy this sort of thing? - he asked suddenly.
The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over
his face.
- Enjoy? - he boomed. - What do you mean?
- What I mean, - said Ford, - is does it give you a full satisfying life? Stomping
around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships...
The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled
over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said,
- Well the hours are good...
- They’d have to be, - agreed Ford.
Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford.
- Ford, what are you doing? - he asked in an amazed whisper.
- Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK? - he said.
- So the hours are pretty good then? - he resumed.
The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the
murky depths.
- Yeah, - he said, - but now you come to mention it, most of the actual
minutes are pretty lousy. Except... - he thought again, which required looking
at the ceiling - except some of the shouting I quite like. - He ﬁlled his lungs and
bellowed, - Resistance is...
- Sure, yes, - interrupted Ford hurriedly, - you’re good at that, I can tell.
But if it’s mostly lousy, - he said, slowly giving the words time to reach their
mark, - then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The leather? The
machismo? Or do you just ﬁnd that coming to terms with the mindless tedium
of it all presents an interesting challenge?
- Er... - said the guard, - er... er... I dunno. I think I just sort of... do it
really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young Vogon
- you know, the uniform, the lowslung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium...
- There you are Arthur, - said Ford with the air of someone reaching the
conclusion of his argument, - you think you’ve got problems.
Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his
home planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already and he didn’t like
the sound of being thrown into space very much.
- Try and understand his problem, - insisted Ford. - Here he is poor lad, his
entire life’s work is stamping around, throwing people oﬀ spaceships...
- And shouting, - added the guard.
- And shouting, sure, - said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round
his neck in friendly condescension, - ...and he doesn’t even know why he’s doing
it!
Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble gesture,
because he was too asphyxicated to speak.
Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.
- Well. Now you put it like that I suppose...
- Good lad! - encouraged Ford.
- But alright, - went on the rumblings, - so what’s the alternative?"

Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford.
- Ford, what are you doing? - he asked in an amazed whisper.
- Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK? - he said.
- So the hours are pretty good then? - he resumed.
The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the
murky depths.
- Yeah, - he said, - but now you come to mention it, most of the actual
minutes are pretty lousy. Except... - he thought again, which required looking
at the ceiling - except some of the shouting I quite like. - He ﬁlled his lungs and
bellowed, - Resistance is...
- Sure, yes, - interrupted Ford hurriedly, - you’re good at that, I can tell.
But if it’s mostly lousy, - he said, slowly giving the words time to reach their
mark, - then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The leather? The
machismo? Or do you just ﬁnd that coming to terms with the mindless tedium
of it all presents an interesting challenge?
- Er... - said the guard, - er... er... I dunno. I think I just sort of... do it
really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young Vogon
- you know, the uniform, the lowslung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium...
- There you are Arthur, - said Ford with the air of someone reaching the
conclusion of his argument, - you think you’ve got problems.
Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his
home planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already and he didn’t like
the sound of being thrown into space very much.
- Try and understand his problem, - insisted Ford. - Here he is poor lad, his
entire life’s work is stamping around, throwing people oﬀ spaceships...
- And shouting, - added the guard.
- And shouting, sure, - said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round
his neck in friendly condescension, - ...and he doesn’t even know why he’s doing
it!
Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble gesture,
because he was too asphyxicated to speak.
Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.
- Well. Now you put it like that I suppose...
- Good lad! - encouraged Ford.
- But alright, - went on the rumblings, - so what’s the alternative?"
314,How does Ford try to encourage the Vogon guard to consider alternatives to his current job?,"46 CHAPTER 7.
- And you can shut up as well! - snapped Ford.
- Resistance is useless!
- Oh give it a rest, - said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking
straight up into his captor’s face. A thought struck him.
- Do you really enjoy this sort of thing? - he asked suddenly.
The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over
his face.
- Enjoy? - he boomed. - What do you mean?
- What I mean, - said Ford, - is does it give you a full satisfying life? Stomping
around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships...
The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled
over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said,
- Well the hours are good...
- They’d have to be, - agreed Ford.
Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford.
- Ford, what are you doing? - he asked in an amazed whisper.
- Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK? - he said.
- So the hours are pretty good then? - he resumed.

- Well. Now you put it like that I suppose...
- Good lad! - encouraged Ford.
- But alright, - went on the rumblings, - so what’s the alternative?"
315,What was Ford's suggestion to the guard in order to stop doing something?,"47
- Well, - said Ford, brightly but slowly, - stop doing it of course! Tell them,
- he went on, - you’re not going to do it anymore. - He felt he had to add
something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind
occupied pondering that much.
- Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... - said the guard, - erm,
well that doesn’t sound that great to me.
Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away.
- Now wait a minute, - he said, - that’s just the start you see, there’s more
to it than that you see...
But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original
purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was obviously quite touched.
- No, I think if it’s all the same to you, - he said, - I’d better get you both
shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting
I’ve got to do.
It wasn’t all the same to Ford Prefect after all.
- Come on now... but look! - he said, less slowly, less brightly.
- Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn... - said Arthur without any clear inﬂection.
- But hang on, - pursued Ford, - there’s music and art and things to tell you
about yet! Arrrggghhh!
- Resistance is useless, - bellowed the guard, and then added, - You see if I
keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Oﬃcer, and there
aren’t usually many vacancies for non-shouting and non-pushing-people-about
oﬃcers, so I think I’d better stick to what I know.
They had now reached the airlock - a large circular steel hatchway of massive
strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The guard operated a
control and the hatchway swung smoothly open.
- But thanks for taking an interest, - said the Vogon guard. - Bye now. He
ﬂung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within.
Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round and ﬂung his shoulder
uselessly against the reclosing hatchway.
- But listen, - he shouted to the guard, - there’s a whole world you don’t
know anything about... here how about this? - Desperately he grabbed for the
only bit of culture he knew oﬀhand - he hummed the ﬁrst bar of Beethoven’s
Fifth.
- Da da da dum! Doesn’t that stir anything in you?
- No, - said the guard, - not really. But I’ll mention it to my aunt.
If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself
tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of the ship’s engines.
They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diam-
eter and ten feet long.
- Potentially bright lad I thought, - he said and slumped against the curved
wall.
Arthur was still lying in the curve of the ﬂoor where he had fallen. He didn’t
look up. He just lay panting.
- We’re trapped now aren’t we?
- Yes, - said Ford, - we’re trapped.
- Well didn’t you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to
think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and didn’t notice.
- Oh yes, I thought of something, - panted Ford. Arthur looked up expec-
tantly."
316,Why did the guard seem hesitant about Ford's suggestion?,"47

Fifth.
- Da da da dum! Doesn’t that stir anything in you?
- No, - said the guard, - not really. But I’ll mention it to my aunt.
If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself
tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of the ship’s engines.
They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diam-
eter and ten feet long.
- Potentially bright lad I thought, - he said and slumped against the curved
wall.
Arthur was still lying in the curve of the ﬂoor where he had fallen. He didn’t
look up. He just lay panting.
- We’re trapped now aren’t we?
- Yes, - said Ford, - we’re trapped.
- Well didn’t you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to
think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and didn’t notice.
- Oh yes, I thought of something, - panted Ford. Arthur looked up expec-
tantly."
323,How did Ford's actions and words demonstrate his character in the given context?,"47
- Well, - said Ford, brightly but slowly, - stop doing it of course! Tell them,
- he went on, - you’re not going to do it anymore. - He felt he had to add
something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind
occupied pondering that much.
- Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... - said the guard, - erm,
well that doesn’t sound that great to me.
Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away.
- Now wait a minute, - he said, - that’s just the start you see, there’s more
to it than that you see...
But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original
purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was obviously quite touched.
- No, I think if it’s all the same to you, - he said, - I’d better get you both
shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting
I’ve got to do.
It wasn’t all the same to Ford Prefect after all.
- Come on now... but look! - he said, less slowly, less brightly.
- Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn... - said Arthur without any clear inﬂection.
- But hang on, - pursued Ford, - there’s music and art and things to tell you
about yet! Arrrggghhh!
- Resistance is useless, - bellowed the guard, and then added, - You see if I
keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Oﬃcer, and there
aren’t usually many vacancies for non-shouting and non-pushing-people-about
oﬃcers, so I think I’d better stick to what I know.
They had now reached the airlock - a large circular steel hatchway of massive
strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The guard operated a
control and the hatchway swung smoothly open.
- But thanks for taking an interest, - said the Vogon guard. - Bye now. He
ﬂung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within.
Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round and ﬂung his shoulder
uselessly against the reclosing hatchway.
- But listen, - he shouted to the guard, - there’s a whole world you don’t
know anything about... here how about this? - Desperately he grabbed for the
only bit of culture he knew oﬀhand - he hummed the ﬁrst bar of Beethoven’s

325,What was Ford's initial reaction to being on the other side of the airtight hatchway?,"48 CHAPTER 7.
- But unfortunately, - continued Ford, - it rather involved being on the other
side of this airtight hatchway. - He kicked the hatch they’d just been through.
- But it was a good idea was it?
- Oh yes, very neat.
- What was it?
- Well I hadn’t worked out the details yet. Not much point now is there?
- So... er, what happens next?
- Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few
moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and asphyxicate. If you
take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds of course... -
said Ford. He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started
to hum an old Betelgeusian battle hymn. To Arthur’s eyes he suddenly looked
very alien.
- So this is it, - said Arthur, - we’re going to die.
- Yes, - said Ford, - except... no! Wait a minute! - he suddenly lunged across
the chamber at something behind Arthur’s line of vision. - What’s this switch?
- he cried.
- What? Where? - cried Arthur twisting round.
- No, I was only fooling, - said Ford, - we are going to die after all.
He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he
left oﬀ.
- You know, - said Arthur, - it’s at times like this, when I’m trapped in a
Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxication
in deep space that I really wish I’d listened to what my mother told me when I
was young.
- Why, what did she tell you?
- I don’t know, I didn’t listen.
- Oh. - Ford carried on humming.
- This is terriﬁc, - Arthur thought to himself, - Nelson’s Column has gone,
McDonald’s have gone, all that’s left is me and the words Mostly Harmless. Any
second now all that will be left is Mostly Harmless. And yesterday the planet
seemed to be going so well.

330,What is the significance of the planet Bethselamin in the context of the information provided in Chapter 8 of The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy?,"Chapter 8
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It has been
compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many diﬀerent
editorships. It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and
researchers.
The introduction begins like this:
- Space, - it says, - is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly
hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it’s a long way down the
road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space. Listen... - and so on.
(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things
you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Beth-
selamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visit-
ing tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and
the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your
bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally
important to get a receipt.)
To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances be-
tween the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide’s intro-
duction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in
reading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.
The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not ﬁt into the human
imagination.
Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years
to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes
eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and
four years more to arrive at Sol’s nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.
For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for
instance, takes rather longer: ﬁve hundred thousand years.
The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under ﬁve years, but you
don’t get to see much on the way.
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air
you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However
it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the
chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two
to the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine
to one against.
By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an
Islington ﬂat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice

336,What unexpected event occurred in the Galaxy that led to the death of a group of market analysts and the materialization of fried eggs on the planet Poghril?,"Chapter 9
A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close
itself for no apparent reason.
This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.
A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a
second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years
from end to end.
As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted
oﬀ through the universe. A team of seven threefoot-high market analysts fell
out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly of surprise.
Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too,
materializing in a large woobly heap on the faminestruck land of Poghril in the
Pansel system.
The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man
who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later.
The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards
and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. Somewhere in the
deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms
drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in
the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to
copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns)
and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That
was how life began in the Universe.
Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed
up a pavement.
On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half-spent
ﬁsh.
- There you are, - gasped Ford, scrabbling for a ﬁngerhold on the pavement
as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, - I told you I’d think of
something.
- Oh sure, - said Arthur, - sure.
- Bright idea of mine, - said Ford, - to ﬁnd a passing spaceship and get
rescued by it.
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various pretend
ones ﬂitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal light exploded, splattering
space-time as with gobbets of junket. Time blossomed, matter shrank away.
The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for
ever.

A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a
second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years
from end to end.
As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted
oﬀ through the universe. A team of seven threefoot-high market analysts fell
out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly of surprise.
Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too,
materializing in a large woobly heap on the faminestruck land of Poghril in the
Pansel system.
The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man
who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later.
The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards
and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. Somewhere in the
deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms
drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in
the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to
copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns)
and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That
was how life began in the Universe.
Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed
up a pavement.
On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half-spent
ﬁsh.
- There you are, - gasped Ford, scrabbling for a ﬁngerhold on the pavement
as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, - I told you I’d think of
something.
- Oh sure, - said Arthur, - sure.
- Bright idea of mine, - said Ford, - to ﬁnd a passing spaceship and get
rescued by it.
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various pretend
ones ﬂitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal light exploded, splattering
space-time as with gobbets of junket. Time blossomed, matter shrank away.
The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for
ever.

341,What were the reactions of Arthur and Ford when they opened their eyes and found themselves in an unexpected location?,"52 CHAPTER 9.
- Oh come oﬀ it, - said Arthur, - the chances against it were astronomical.
- Don’t knock it, it worked, - said Ford.
- What sort of ship are we in? - asked Arthur as the pit of eternity yawned
beneath them.
- I don’t know, - said Ford, - I haven’t opened my eyes yet.
- No, nor have I, - said Arthur.
The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected
directions.
Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise.
- Good god, - said Arthur, - it looks just like the sea front at Southend.
- Hell, I’m relieved to hear you say that, - said Ford.
- Why?
- Because I thought I must be going mad.
- Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it.
Ford thought about this.
- Well, did you say it or didn’t you? - he asked.
- I think so, - said Arthur.
- Well, perhaps we’re both going mad.
- Yes, - said Arthur, - we’d be mad, all things considered, to think this was
Southend.
- Well, do you think this is Southend?
- Oh yes.
- So do I.
- Therefore we must be mad.
- Nice day for it.
- Yes, - said a passing maniac.
- Who was that? - asked Arthur
- Who - the man with the ﬁve heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers?
- Yes.
- I don’t know. Just someone.
- Ah.
They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge
children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered through the
sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the Uncertain Areas.
- You know, - said Arthur with a slight cough, - if this is Southend, there’s
something very odd about it...
- You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep washing up
and down? - said Ford. - Yes I thought that was odd too. In fact, - he continued
as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six equal segments which danced
and span giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formation, - there is
something altogether very strange going on.
Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot dough-
nuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid ﬁsh stormed out of the
sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for it.
They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought,
valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard
a girl’s voice.
It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, - Two to the power of one
hundred thousand to one against and falling, - and that was all."

- Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, ﬁve to four against.

improbable you know.

- No, the measurement of probability!

ment.
Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges.

in unusual directions. - Southend seems to be melting away... the stars are
swirling... a dustbowl... my legs are drifting oﬀ into the sunset... my left arm’s
come oﬀ too. - A frightening thought struck him: - Hell, - he said, - how am I

Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle.
- Hey, who are you, - he quacked. - Where are you? What’s going on and is
there any way of stopping it?
- Please relax, - said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with
only one wing and two engines one of which is on ﬁre, - you are perfectly safe.
- But that’s not the point! - raged Ford. - The point is that I am now a
perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!
- It’s alright, I’ve got them back now, - said Arthur.
- Two to the power of ﬁfty thousand to one against and falling, - said the
voice.
- Admittedly, - said Arthur, - they’re longer than I usually like them, but...
- Isn’t there anything, - squawked Ford in avian fury, - you feel you ought
to be telling us?
The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped oﬀ into the distance.
- Welcome, - the voice said, - to the Starship Heart of Gold.
The voice continued.
- Please do not be alarmed, - it said, - by anything you see or hear around
you. You are bound to feel some initial ill eﬀects as you have been rescued
from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred
and seventy-six thousand to one against - possibly much higher. We are now
cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-ﬁve thousand to one against

350,What was the name of the spaceship that the voice revealed to Ford and Arthur?,"53
Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to ﬁnd a source
for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe in.
- What was that voice? - shouted Arthur.
- I don’t know, - yelled Ford, - I don’t know. It sounded like a measurement
of probability.
- Probability? What do you mean?
- Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, ﬁve to four against.
It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against. That’s pretty
improbable you know.
A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning.
- But what does it mean? - cried Arthur.
- What, the custard?
- No, the measurement of probability!
- I don’t know. I don’t know at all. I think we’re on some kind of spaceship.
- I can only assume, - said Arthur, - that this is not the ﬁrst-class compart-
ment.
Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges.
- Haaaauuurrgghhh... - said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending
in unusual directions. - Southend seems to be melting away... the stars are
swirling... a dustbowl... my legs are drifting oﬀ into the sunset... my left arm’s
come oﬀ too. - A frightening thought struck him: - Hell, - he said, - how am I
going to operate my digital watch now? - He wound his eyes desperately around
in Ford’s direction.
- Ford, - he said, - you’re turning into a penguin. Stop it.
Again came the voice.
- Two to the power of seventy-ﬁve thousand to one against and falling.
Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle.
- Hey, who are you, - he quacked. - Where are you? What’s going on and is
there any way of stopping it?
- Please relax, - said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with
only one wing and two engines one of which is on ﬁre, - you are perfectly safe.
- But that’s not the point! - raged Ford. - The point is that I am now a
perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!
- It’s alright, I’ve got them back now, - said Arthur.
- Two to the power of ﬁfty thousand to one against and falling, - said the
voice.
- Admittedly, - said Arthur, - they’re longer than I usually like them, but...
- Isn’t there anything, - squawked Ford in avian fury, - you feel you ought
to be telling us?
The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped oﬀ into the distance.
- Welcome, - the voice said, - to the Starship Heart of Gold.
The voice continued.
- Please do not be alarmed, - it said, - by anything you see or hear around
you. You are bound to feel some initial ill eﬀects as you have been rescued
from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred
and seventy-six thousand to one against - possibly much higher. We are now

361,Explain the discovery and development of the Inﬁnite Improbability Drive as described in Chapter 10.,"Chapter 10
The Inﬁnite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast
interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace.
It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable
form of propulsion by the Galactic Government’s research team on Damogran.
This, brieﬂy, is the story of its discovery.
The principle of generating small amounts of ﬁnite improbability by simply
hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 SubMeson Brain to an atomic
vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot
cup of tea) were of course well understood - and such generators were often
used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess’s
undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the
Theory of Indeterminacy.
Many respectable physicists said that they weren’t going to stand for this -
partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn’t
get invited to those sort of parties.
Another thing they couldn’t stand was the perpetual failure they encoun-
tered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the inﬁnite im-
probability ﬁeld needed to ﬂip a spaceship across the mind-paralysing distances
between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such
a machine was virtually impossible.
Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a
particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way:
If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it
must logically be a ﬁnite improbability. So all I have to do in order to make
one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that ﬁgure into the ﬁnite
improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea... and turn it on!
He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to
create the long sought after golden Inﬁnite Improbability generator out of thin
air.
It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic
Institute’s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob
of respectable physicists who had ﬁnally realized that the one thing they really
couldn’t stand was a smartass.

364,Describe the student's reasoning process that led to the creation of the Inﬁnite Improbability generator.,"Chapter 10
The Inﬁnite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast
interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace.
It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable
form of propulsion by the Galactic Government’s research team on Damogran.
This, brieﬂy, is the story of its discovery.
The principle of generating small amounts of ﬁnite improbability by simply
hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 SubMeson Brain to an atomic
vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot
cup of tea) were of course well understood - and such generators were often
used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess’s
undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the
Theory of Indeterminacy.
Many respectable physicists said that they weren’t going to stand for this -
partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn’t
get invited to those sort of parties.
Another thing they couldn’t stand was the perpetual failure they encoun-
tered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the inﬁnite im-
probability ﬁeld needed to ﬂip a spaceship across the mind-paralysing distances
between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such
a machine was virtually impossible.
Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a
particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way:
If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it
must logically be a ﬁnite improbability. So all I have to do in order to make
one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that ﬁgure into the ﬁnite
improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea... and turn it on!
He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to
create the long sought after golden Inﬁnite Improbability generator out of thin
air.
It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic
Institute’s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob
of respectable physicists who had ﬁnally realized that the one thing they really
couldn’t stand was a smartass.

The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a per-
fectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was
so new. Some of the control seats hadn’t had the plastic wrapping taken oﬀ
yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish
restaurant. In fact it wasn’t perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked
round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners were contoured
in excitingly chunky shapes. The truth of the matter is that it would have been
a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three-
dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have got miserable. As it
was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over
the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks
of computers set into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its
gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel
knees. It too was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and
polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid
body didn’t quite ﬁt properly. In fact they ﬁtted perfectly well, but something
in its bearing suggested that they might have ﬁtted better.
Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his
hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement.
Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading oﬀ ﬁgures. Her
voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the whole ship.
- Five to one against and falling... - she said, - four to one against and
falling... three to one... two... one... probability factor of one to one... we have
normality, I repeat we have normality. - She turned her microphone oﬀ - then
turned it back on, with a slight smile and continued: - Anything you still can’t
cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for
soon.
Zaphod burst out in annoyance:
- Who are they Trillian?
Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged.
- Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space, - she said.
- Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.
- Yeah, well that’s a very sweet thought Trillian, - complained Zaphod, - but
do you really think it’s wise under the circumstances? I mean, here we are on

really understood the signiﬁcance of anything he did.

to stare through her left shoulder.

blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that

really understood the signiﬁcance of anything he did.

- Life, - said Marvin, - don’t talk to me about life.
He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the cabin. With
a satisﬁed hum and a click the door closed behind him
- I don’t think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod, - growled Trillian.
The Encyclopaedia Galactica deﬁnes a robot as a mechanical apparatus de-
signed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation deﬁnes a robot as ”Your Plastic Pal Who’s Fun To Be With”.
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy deﬁnes the marketing division of the
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as ”a bunch of mindless jerks who’ll be the ﬁrst
against the wall when the revolution comes”, with a footnote to the eﬀect that
the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over
the post of robotics correspondent.
Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that had the
good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future
deﬁned the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as ”a bunch
of mindless jerks who were the ﬁrst against the wall when the revolution came”.
The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away
to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation
area of the ship. It was rather smart.
- I think the ship’s brand new, - said Ford.
- How can you tell? - asked Arthur. - Have you got some exotic device for
measuring the age of metal?
- No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the ﬂoor. It’s a lot of ‘the
Universe can be yours’ stuﬀ. Ah! Look, I was right.
Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur.
- It says: Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics. As soon
as the ship’s drive reaches Inﬁnite Improbability it passes through every point
in the Universe. Be the envy of other major governments. Wow, this is big
league stuﬀ.
Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally
gasping with astonishment at what he read - clearly Galactic astrotechnology
had moved ahead during the years of his exile.
Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast
majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind wander, trailing his
ﬁngers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out"

and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up
with the words Please do not press this button again. He shook himself.
- Listen, - said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, - they
make a big thing of the ship’s cybernetics. A new generation of Sirius Cyber-
netics Corporation robots and computers, with the new GPP feature.
- GPP feature? - said Arthur. - What’s that?
- Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities.
- Oh, - said Arthur, - sounds ghastly.
A voice behind them said,
- It is. - The voice was low and hopeless and accompanied by a slight clanking
sound. They span round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the
doorway.
- What? - they said.
- Ghastly, - continued Marvin, - it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don’t
even talk about it. Look at this door, - he said, stepping through it. The
irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales
brochure. - All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition.
It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with
the knowledge of a job well done.
As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have
a satisﬁed sigh-like quality to it.
- Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah! - it said.
Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with
disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it
Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What’s the point? Nothing is
worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the
molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids’ brain cells. For a
quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding
cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of despair
shook the robot’s body as he turned.
- Come on, - he droned, - I’ve been ordered to take you down to the bridge.
Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the
bridge. Call that job satisfaction? ’Cos I don’t.
He turned and walked back to the hated door.
- Er, excuse me, - said Ford following after him, - which government owns
this ship?
Marvin ignored him.
- You watch this door, - he muttered, - it’s about to open again. I can tell
by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates.
With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and Marvin stomped
through.
- Come on, - he said.
The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased
little clicks and whirrs.
- Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation,
- said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that
stretched out before them. - Let’s build robots with Genuine People Personali-
ties, - they said. So they tried it out with me. I’m a personality prototype. You
can tell can’t you?
Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers."

411,How does Zaphod operate the radio in the Heart of Gold cabin?,"Chapter 12
A loud clatter of gunk music ﬂooded through the Heart of Gold cabin as Za-
phod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of himself. The machine
was rather diﬃcult to operate. For years radios had been operated by means
of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more so-
phisticated the controls were made touch-sensitive - you merely had to brush
the panels with your ﬁngers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in
the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular
expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you
wanted to keep listening to the same programme.
Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk music,
but this time it was a background to a news announcement. The news was
always heavily edited to ﬁt the rhythms of the music.
- ...and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, broadcasting
around the galaxy around the clock, - squawked a voice, - and we’ll be saying a
big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere... and to everyone else out there,
the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news story
tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship
by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox. And the question
everyone’s asking is... has the big Z ﬁnally ﬂipped? Beeblebrox, the man who
invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex-conﬁdence trickster, once described
by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted
the Wort Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time...
has he got an answer this time? We asked his private brain care specialist Gag
Halfrunt... - The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke
in, presumably Halfrunt. He said: - Vell, Zaphod’s jist zis guy you know? - but
got no further because an electric pencil ﬂew across the cabin and through the
radio’s on/oﬀ sensitive airspace. Zaphod turned and glared at Trillian - she had
thrown the pencil.
- Hey, - he said, what do you do that for?
Trillian was tapping her ﬁngers on a screenful of ﬁgures.
- I’ve just thought of something, - she said.
- Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?
- You hear enough about yourself as it is.
- I’m very insecure. We know that.
- Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important.
- If there’s anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught
and shot now. - Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed.

- Mmmmm, - said Zaphod, - ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha?
- Well? - said Trillian.
- Er... what does the Z mean? - said Zaphod.
- Which one?
- Any one.
One of the major diﬃculties Trillian experienced in her relationship with
Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people oﬀ their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn’t be
bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be
outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn’t understand what
was going on, and really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being
amazingly clever and quite clearly was so - but not all the time, which obviously
worried him, hence the act. He proﬀered people to be puzzled rather than
contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but
she could no longer be bothered to argue about it.
She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could make
it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way.
- There, - she pointed, - right there.
- Hey... Yeah! - said Zaphod.
- Well? - she said.
- Well what?
Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her
head. She said, very calmly,
- It’s the same sector you originally picked me up in.
He looked at her and then looked back at the screen.
- Hey, yeah, - he said, - now that is wild. We should have zapped straight
into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula. How did we come to be there? I mean
that’s nowhere.
She ignored this.
- Improbability Drive, - she said patiently. - You explained it to me yourself.
We pass through every point in the Universe, you know that.
- Yeah, but that’s one wild coincidence isn’t it?
- Yes.
- Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the Universe to
choose from? That’s just too... I want to work this out. Computer!
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which controlled
and permeated every particle of the ship switched into communication mode.
- Hi there! - it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of
ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said, Hi there!
- Oh God, - said Zaphod. He hadn’t worked with this computer for long but
had already learned to loathe it.
The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent."

minus-one (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in Im-
probability physics).

Zaphod and Trillian pored over the ﬁgures that the Improbability ﬂight path
scanner ﬂashed silently up in front of them.
- Can we work out, - said Zaphod, - from their point of view what the
Improbability of their rescue was?
- Yes, that’s a constant - , said Trillian, - two to the power of two hundred
and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine to one against.
- That’s high. They’re two lucky lucky guys.
- Yes.
- But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up...
Trillian punched up the ﬁgures. They showed tow-to-the powerof-Inﬁnity-
minus-one (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in Im-
probability physics).
- ...it’s pretty low, - continued Zaphod with a slight whistle.
- Yes, - agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically.
- That’s one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. Something
pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance sheet if it’s all going to
add up into a pretty sum.
Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil away.
- Bat’s dots, I can’t work it out.
- Well?
Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth.

- No, what? - said Arthur, who didn’t what to know.
- We’ve arrived at another of those doors.
There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor. Marvin eyed it
suspiciously.
- Well? - said Ford impatiently. - Do we go through?
- Do we go through? - mimicked Marvin. - Yes. This is the entrance to the
bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the highest demand that
will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn’t wonder.
Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a hunter stalk-
ing his prey. Suddenly it slid open.
- Thank you, - it said, - for making a simple door very happy.
Deep in Marvin’s thorax gears ground.
- Funny, - he intoned funerally, - how just when you think life can’t possibly
get any worse it suddenly does.
He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur staring at
each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside they heard Marvin’s
voice again.
- I suppose you want to see the aliens now, - he said. - Do you want me to
sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I’m standing?
- Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin? - came another voice.
Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing.
- What’s...?
- Shhh, - said Ford, - come in.
He stepped through into the bridge.
Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling
back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the teeth in his right-

Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning.
- ...and then of course I’ve got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my
left hand side...
- No? - said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. - Really?
- Oh yes, - said Marvin, - I mean I’ve asked for them to be replaced but no
one ever listens.
- I can imagine.
Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford.
- Well well well, - he kept saying to himself, - Zaphod Beeblebrox...

preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed,
nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn’t believe he was
seeing was fairly large. His jaw ﬂapped about at a loose end for a while.
The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling aﬀecta-
tion of nonchalance said,
- Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in.
Ford was not going to be outcooled.
- Zaphod, - he drawled, - great to see you, you’re looking well, the extra arm
suits you. Nice ship you’ve stolen.
Arthur goggled at him.
- You mean you know this guy? - he said, waving a wild ﬁnger at Zaphod.
- Know him! - exclaimed Ford, - he’s... - he paused, and decided to do the
introductions the other way round.
- Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent, - he said, - I saved him
when his planet blew up.
- Oh sure, - said Zaphod, - hi Arthur, glad you could make it. - His right-
hand head looked round casually, said ”hi” and went back to having his teeth
picked.
Ford carried on.
- And Arthur, - he said, - this is my semi-cousin Zaphod Beeb...
- We’ve met, - said Arthur sharply.
When you’re cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past
a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then
accidentally change down from fourth to ﬁrst instead of third thus making your
engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you oﬀ
your stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect oﬀ his.
- Err... what?
- I said we’ve met.
Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply.
- Hey... er, have we? Hey... er...
Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry ﬂash in his eyes. Now he felt he
was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself
with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about the aﬀairs of the Galaxy
as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life in Peking.
- What do you mean you’ve met? - he demanded. - This is Zaphod Beeble-
brox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon.
- I don’t care, - said Arthur coldly. We’ve met, haven’t we Zaphod Beeble-
brox - or should I say... Phil?
- What! - shouted Ford.
- You’ll have to remind me, - said Zaphod. - I’ve a terrible memory for
species.
- It was at a party, - pursued Arthur.
- Yeah, well I doubt that, - said Zaphod.
- Cool it will you Arthur! - demanded Ford.
Arthur would not be deterred.

Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile.

hand head with his left hand. The right-hand head seemed to be thoroughly
preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed,
nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn’t believe he was
seeing was fairly large. His jaw ﬂapped about at a loose end for a while.
The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling aﬀecta-
tion of nonchalance said,
- Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in.
Ford was not going to be outcooled.
- Zaphod, - he drawled, - great to see you, you’re looking well, the extra arm
suits you. Nice ship you’ve stolen.
Arthur goggled at him.
- You mean you know this guy? - he said, waving a wild ﬁnger at Zaphod.
- Know him! - exclaimed Ford, - he’s... - he paused, and decided to do the
introductions the other way round.
- Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent, - he said, - I saved him
when his planet blew up.
- Oh sure, - said Zaphod, - hi Arthur, glad you could make it. - His right-
hand head looked round casually, said ”hi” and went back to having his teeth
picked.
Ford carried on.
- And Arthur, - he said, - this is my semi-cousin Zaphod Beeb...
- We’ve met, - said Arthur sharply.
When you’re cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past
a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then
accidentally change down from fourth to ﬁrst instead of third thus making your
engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you oﬀ
your stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect oﬀ his.
- Err... what?
- I said we’ve met.
Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply.
- Hey... er, have we? Hey... er...
Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry ﬂash in his eyes. Now he felt he
was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself
with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about the aﬀairs of the Galaxy
as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life in Peking.
- What do you mean you’ve met? - he demanded. - This is Zaphod Beeble-
brox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon.
- I don’t care, - said Arthur coldly. We’ve met, haven’t we Zaphod Beeble-
brox - or should I say... Phil?
- What! - shouted Ford.
- You’ll have to remind me, - said Zaphod. - I’ve a terrible memory for
species.
- It was at a party, - pursued Arthur.
- Yeah, well I doubt that, - said Zaphod.
- Cool it will you Arthur! - demanded Ford.
Arthur would not be deterred.
- A party six months ago. On Earth... England...
Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile.

This wasn’t fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards between
Arthur and Zaphod.
- What? - he said to Zaphod.
- You don’t mean to say you’ve been on that miserable planet as well do
you?
- No, of course not, - said Zaphod breezily. - Well, I may have just dropped
in brieﬂy, you know, on my way somewhere...
- But I was stuck there for ﬁfteen years!
- Well I didn’t know that did I?
- But what were you doing there?
- Looking about, you know.
- He gatecrashed a party, - persisted Arthur, trembling with anger, - a fancy
dress party...
- It would have to be, wouldn’t it? - said Ford.
- At this party, - persisted Arthur, - was a girl... oh well, look it doesn’t
matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke anyway...
- I wish you’d stop sulking about that bloody planet, - said Ford. - Who
was the lady?
- Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn’t doing very well with her. I’d
been trying all evening. Hell, she was something though. Beautiful, charming,
devastatingly intelligent, at last I’d got her to myself for a bit and was plying
her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says Hey doll, is
this guy boring you? Why don’t you talk to me instead? I’m from a diﬀerent
planet. - I never saw her again.
- Zaphod? - exclaimed Ford.
- Yes, - said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. - He only
had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, but...
- But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet, - said
Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge. She gave Arthur
a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks and then turned her
attention to the ship’s controls again.
There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled mess of
Arthur’s brain crawled some words.
- Tricia McMillian? - he said. - What are you doing here?
- Same as you, - she said, - I hitched a lift. After all with a degree in Maths
and another in astrophysics what else was there to do? It was either that or the
dole queue again on Monday.
- Inﬁnity minus one, - chattered the computer, - Improbability sum now
complete.
Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian.
- Trillian, - he said, - is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use
the Improbability drive?
- Very probably, I’m afraid, - she said."

471,What principle of physics brought the crew of the Heart of Gold together?,"Chapter 14
The Heart of Gold ﬂed on silently through the night of space, now on conven-
tional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had
been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but
by some curious principle of physics - as if relationships between people were
susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and
molecules.
As the ship’s artiﬁcial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to
separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts.
Trillian couldn’t sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which
contained her last and only links with Earth - two white mice that she had
insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had expected not to see the planet again,
but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the planet’s destruction. It
seemed remote and unreal and she could ﬁnd no thoughts to think about it. She
watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little
plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she shook
herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny ﬂashing lights and
ﬁgures that charted the ship’s progress through the void. She wished she knew
what it was she was trying not to think about.
Zaphod couldn’t sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he wouldn’t
let himself think about. For as long as he could remember he’d suﬀered from
a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. Most of the time he was able to
put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been re-awakened by
the sudden inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it
seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn’t see.
Ford couldn’t sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again.
Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he was ﬁnally beginning
to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot
of fun, though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his semi-cousin
that he couldn’t put his ﬁnger on. The fact that he had become President of
the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post.
Was there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod,
he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned
unfathomably into an art form. He attacked everything in life with a mixture
of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often diﬃcult to tell
which was which.
Arthur slept: he was terribly tired.

As the ship’s artiﬁcial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to
separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts.
Trillian couldn’t sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which
contained her last and only links with Earth - two white mice that she had
insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had expected not to see the planet again,
but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the planet’s destruction. It
seemed remote and unreal and she could ﬁnd no thoughts to think about it. She
watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little
plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she shook
herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny ﬂashing lights and
ﬁgures that charted the ship’s progress through the void. She wished she knew
what it was she was trying not to think about.
Zaphod couldn’t sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he wouldn’t
let himself think about. For as long as he could remember he’d suﬀered from
a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. Most of the time he was able to
put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been re-awakened by
the sudden inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it
seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn’t see.
Ford couldn’t sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again.
Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he was ﬁnally beginning
to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot
of fun, though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his semi-cousin
that he couldn’t put his ﬁnger on. The fact that he had become President of
the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post.
Was there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod,
he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned
unfathomably into an art form. He attacked everything in life with a mixture
of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often diﬃcult to tell
which was which.
Arthur slept: he was terribly tired.

Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was a small
computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while and tried to compose a
new entry for the Guide on the subject of Vogons but couldn’t think of anything
vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went
for a walk to the bridge.
As he entered he was surprised to see two ﬁgures hunched excitedly over the
instruments.
- See? The ship’s about to move into orbit, - Trillian was saying. - There’s
a planet out there. It’s at the exact coordinates you predicted.
Zaphod heard a noise and looked up.
- Ford! - he hissed. - Hey, come and take a look at this.
Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of ﬁgures ﬂashing over a
screen.
- You recognize those Galactic coordinates? - said Zaphod.
- No.
- I’ll give you a clue. Computer!
- Hi gang! - enthused the computer. - This is getting real sociable isn’t it?
- Shut up, - said Zaphod, - and show up the screens.
Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and
reﬂected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens.
There was absolutely nothing on them.
- Recognize that? - whispered Zaphod.
Ford frowned.
- Er, no, - he said.
- What do you see?
- Nothing.
- Recognize it?
- What are you talking about?
- We’re in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud.
- And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?
- Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you’d see a dark screen.
- Very good.
Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost child-
ishly so.
- Hey, this is really terriﬁc, this is just far too much!
- What’s so great about being stuck in a dust cloud? - said Ford.
- What would you reckon to ﬁnd here? - urged Zaphod.

- No.
- Computer! - shouted Zaphod, - rotate angle of vision through oneeighty
degrees and don’t talk about it!

vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went
for a walk to the bridge.
As he entered he was surprised to see two ﬁgures hunched excitedly over the
instruments.
- See? The ship’s about to move into orbit, - Trillian was saying. - There’s
a planet out there. It’s at the exact coordinates you predicted.
Zaphod heard a noise and looked up.
- Ford! - he hissed. - Hey, come and take a look at this.
Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of ﬁgures ﬂashing over a
screen.
- You recognize those Galactic coordinates? - said Zaphod.
- No.
- I’ll give you a clue. Computer!
- Hi gang! - enthused the computer. - This is getting real sociable isn’t it?
- Shut up, - said Zaphod, - and show up the screens.
Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and
reﬂected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens.
There was absolutely nothing on them.
- Recognize that? - whispered Zaphod.
Ford frowned.
- Er, no, - he said.
- What do you see?
- Nothing.
- Recognize it?
- What are you talking about?
- We’re in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud.
- And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?
- Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you’d see a dark screen.
- Very good.
Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost child-
ishly so.
- Hey, this is really terriﬁc, this is just far too much!
- What’s so great about being stuck in a dust cloud? - said Ford.
- What would you reckon to ﬁnd here? - urged Zaphod.
- Nothing.
- No stars? No planets?
- No.
- Computer! - shouted Zaphod, - rotate angle of vision through oneeighty
degrees and don’t talk about it!

glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the size of a small plate crept
across it followed quickly by another one - a binary system. Then a vast crescent"

Entry: Magrathea)
Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the
former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free.
Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and
reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space. In those days spirits
were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women,
and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures
from Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty
deeds, to boldly split inﬁnitives that no man had split before - and thus was the
Empire forged.
Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural
and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor - at least no
one worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most successful merchants
life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that
this was therefore the fault of the worlds they’d settled on - none of them was
entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn’t quite right in the later part of
the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the
wrong shade of pink.
And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of special-
ist industry: custom-made luxury planet building. The home of this industry
was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through
white holes in space to form it into dream planets - gold planets, platinum plan-
ets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes - all lovingly made to meet the
exacting standards that the Galaxy’s richest men naturally came to expect.
But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the
richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject
poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen
silence settled over a billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of
scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of
a planned political economy.
Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity
of legend.
In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it.

become economists, it’s...

521,What was Zaphod's reaction to witnessing the binary sunrise on the planet Magrathea?,"78 CHAPTER 16.
They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was ﬁdgety with excite-
ment.
- We are now traversing the night side... - he said in a hushed voice. The
planet rolled on.
- The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us... - he
continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should
have been a great moment. Magrathea! He was piqued by Ford’s sceptical
reaction. Magrathea!
- In a few seconds, - he continued, - we should see... there!
The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp can’t help
but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space, but a binary
sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy.
Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light. It
crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and
within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge
of the horizon with white ﬁre. Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin
atmosphere beneath them.
- The ﬁres of dawn!.. - breathed Zaphod. - The twin suns of Soulianis and
Rahm!..
- Or whatever, - said Ford quietly.
- Soulianis and Rahm! - insisted Zaphod.
The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music ﬂoated
through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans
so much.
As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement burnt inside
him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet, it was enough for
him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some
ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him. All this Magrathea
nonsense seemed juvenile. Isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful
without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?
All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to Arthur. He
edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on.
- I only know what Zaphod’s told me, - she whispered. - Apparently Ma-
grathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in.
Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends say the Magratheans used to
manufacture planets.
Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important.
Suddenly he realized what it was.
- Is there any tea on this spaceship? - he asked.
More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked
along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the black sky, the pyrotechnics
of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding
in the common light of day - grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked
dead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on
the distant horizon - ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities - but as they
approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would
transpire. The planet’s surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of
the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century.
Clearly, it was very very old."

Suddenly he realized what it was.
- Is there any tea on this spaceship? - he asked.
More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked
along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the black sky, the pyrotechnics
of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding
in the common light of day - grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked
dead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on
the distant horizon - ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities - but as they
approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would
transpire. The planet’s surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of
the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century.
Clearly, it was very very old."
526,What worried Ford as he watched the landscape move beneath them?,"79
A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape move
beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, he could feel it as a presence.
He cleared his throat.
- Well, even supposing it is...
- It is, - said Zaphod.
- Which it isn’t, - continued Ford. - What do you want with it anyway?
There’s nothing there.
- Not on the surface, - said Zaphod.
- Alright, just supposing there’s something. I take it you’re not here for the
sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you after?
One of Zaphod’s heads looked away. The other one looked round to see what
the ﬁrst was looking at, but it wasn’t looking at anything very much.
- Well, - said Zaphod airily, - it’s partly the curiosity, partly a sense of
adventure, but mostly I think it’s the fame and the money...
Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that Zaphod
hadn’t the faintest idea why he was there at all.
- You know I don’t like the look of that planet at all, - said Trillian shivering.
- Ah, take no notice, - said Zaphod, - with half the wealth of the former
Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can aﬀord to look frumpy.
Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some ancient
civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely
things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored
there in any form that would still have meaning now. He shrugged.
- I think it’s just a dead planet, - he said.
- The suspense is killing me, - said Arthur testily.
Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of
the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not in any way be
exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance.
The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea.
The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic
defence system will result merely in the breakage of three coﬀee cups and a
micecage, the bruising of somebody’s upper arm, and the untimely creation and
sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale.
In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revela-
tion will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained the bruise. This
fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no signiﬁcance
whatsoever."

538,How does the Nutri-Matic machine function to determine the drink that it provides?,"Chapter 17
After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur’s mind was beginning to reassemble
itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with. He
had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup
ﬁlled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way
it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made
an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject’s taste buds, a spec-
troscopic analysis of the subject’s metabolism and then sent tiny experimental
signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject’s brain to
see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did
this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not
quite, entirely unlike tea. The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by
the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers all
the major land masses of the ﬁrst three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system.
Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the screens
again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past. It
suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him.
- Is it safe? - he said.
- Magrathea’s been dead for ﬁve million years, - said Zaphod, - of course
it’s safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now. -
At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the
bridge - a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It
preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice
said - Greetings to you...
Someone from the dead planet was talking to them.
- Computer! - shouted Zaphod.
- Hi there!
- What the photon is it?
- Oh, just some ﬁve-million-year-old tape that’s being broadcast at us.
- A what? A recording?
- Shush! - said Ford. - It’s carrying on.
The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with
quite unmistakable menace.
- This is a recorded announcement, - it said, - as I’m afraid we’re all out
at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your
esteemed visit...

suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him.

it’s safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now. -

said - Greetings to you...
Someone from the dead planet was talking to them.
- Computer! - shouted Zaphod.
- Hi there!
- What the photon is it?
- Oh, just some ﬁve-million-year-old tape that’s being broadcast at us.
- A what? A recording?

The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with
quite unmistakable menace.

esteemed visit...

itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with. He
had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup
ﬁlled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way
it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made
an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject’s taste buds, a spec-
troscopic analysis of the subject’s metabolism and then sent tiny experimental
signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject’s brain to
see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did
this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not
quite, entirely unlike tea. The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by

- Well? - said Ford.
- Look, - said Zaphod, - will you get it into your heads? That’s just a
recorded message. It’s millions of years old. It doesn’t apply to us, get it?
- What, - said Trillian quietly, - about the missiles?
- Missiles? Don’t make me laugh.
Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen. Clear in
the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere
towards the ship. A quick change of magniﬁcation brought them into close focus

was shocking.
- I think they’re going to have a very good try at applying to us, said Ford.
Zaphod stared at them in astonishment.
- Hey this is terriﬁc! - he said. - Someone down there is trying to kill us!
- Terriﬁc, - said Arthur.
- But don’t you see what this means?
- Yes. We’re going to die.
- Yes, but apart from that.

A short buzz followed, then silence.
- They want to get rid of us, - said Trillian nervously. - What do we do?
- It’s just a recording, - said Zaphod. - We keep going. Got that, computer?
- I got it, - said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed.
They waited.
After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice.
- We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed an-
nouncements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements,
when our clients will once again be able to select from all that’s best in con-
temporary geography. - The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. -
Meanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to
leave. Now.
Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions.
- Well, I suppose we’d better be going then, hadn’t we? - he suggested.
- Shhh! - said Zaphod. - There’s absolutely nothing to be worried about.
- Then why’s everyone so tense?
- They’re just interested! - shouted Zaphod. - Computer, start a descent
into the atmosphere and prepare for landing.

- How soon can we get oﬀ it?
Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became larger.
They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so that all that could
be seen of them now was the warheads, head on.
- As a matter of interest, - said Trillian, - what are we going to do?
- Just keep cool, - said Zaphod.
- Is that all? - shouted Arthur.
- No, we’re also going to... er... take evasive action! - said Zaphod with a
sudden access of panic. - Computer, what evasive action can we take?
- Er, none I’m afraid, guys, - said the computer.
- ...or something, - said Zaphod, - ...er... - he said.
- There seems to be something jamming my guidance system, - explained
the computer brightly, - impact minus forty-ﬁve seconds. Please call me Eddie
if it will help you to relax.
Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously.
- Right! - he said. - Er... we’ve got to get manual control of this ship.
- Can you ﬂy her? - asked Ford pleasantly.
- No, can you?
- No.
- Trillian, can you?
- No.
- Fine, - said Zaphod, relaxing. - We’ll do it together.
- I can’t either, - said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself.
- I’d guessed that, - said Zaphod. - OK computer, I want full manual control
now.
- You got it, - said the computer.
Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up
out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging
and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these controls had never been used before.
Zaphod stared at them wildly.
- OK, Ford, - he said, - full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard. Or
something...
- Good luck guys, - chirped the computer, - impact minus thirty seconds...
Ford leapt to the controls - only a few of them made any immediate sense
to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocked
jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously. He released half of them
and the ship span round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come,
straight towards the oncoming missiles.
Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown
against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held them ﬂattened and
squirming for breath, unable to move. Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic
desperation and ﬁnally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part
of the guidance system.
The lever snapped oﬀ. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards. The
crew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford’s copy of The Hitch
Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console
with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared
to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of

It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained
a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be emphasized because, as had
already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the
deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is
absolutely assured.

up high...

they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction.

In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray
of ferns and yellow ﬂowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the
main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the
illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely
manicured garden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble-
topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs. As you gazed into the
polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible,

hands. Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reﬂect all the

was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue.
In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray
of ferns and yellow ﬂowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the
main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the
illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely
manicured garden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble-
topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs. As you gazed into the
polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible,
and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your
hands. Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reﬂect all the
required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reﬂected
from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful.

whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.

better start ﬁnding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for
the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let’s call it

Good. Ooooh, it’s getting quite strong. And hey, what’s about this whistling
roaring sound going past what I’m suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I
can call that... wind! Is that a good name? It’ll do... perhaps I can ﬁnd a better
name for it later when I’ve found out what it’s for. It must be something very
important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What’s

it about pretty good can’t I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn’t seem to
achieve very much but I’ll probably ﬁnd out what it’s for later on. Now - have
I built up any coherent picture of things yet?
No.
Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to ﬁnd out about, so much
to look forward to, I’m quite dizzy with anticipation...

view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold had now landed.
- Oh, the Paranoid Android, - he said. - Yeah, we’ll take him.
- But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?
- You think you’ve got problems, - said Marvin as if he was addressing a
newly occupied coﬃn, - what are you supposed to do if you are a manically
depressed robot? No, don’t bother to answer that, I’m ﬁfty thousand times
more intelligent than you and even I don’t know the answer. It gives me a
headache just trying to think down to your level.
Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin.
- My white mice have escaped! - she said.
An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod’s
faces.
- Nuts to your white mice, - he said.
Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again.
It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had
it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent
life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by
most independent observers) the second.
- Good afternoon boys.
The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly diﬀerent. It had a matriarchal
twang. It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway
that would let them out on the planet surface.
They looked at each other in puzzlement.
- It’s the computer, - explained Zaphod. - I discovered it had an emergency
back-up personality that I thought might work out better.
- Now this is going to be your ﬁrst day out on a strange new planet, -
continued Eddie’s new voice, - so I want you all wrapped up snug and warm,
and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters.
Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch.
- I’m sorry, - he said, - I think we might be better oﬀ with a slide rule.
- Right! - snapped the computer. - Who said that?
- Will you open the exit hatch please, computer? - said Zaphod trying not
to get angry.

Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin.
- My white mice have escaped! - she said.
An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod’s
faces.
- Nuts to your white mice, - he said.
Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again.
It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had
it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent
life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by
most independent observers) the second.
- Good afternoon boys.
The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly diﬀerent. It had a matriarchal
twang. It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway
that would let them out on the planet surface.
They looked at each other in puzzlement.
- It’s the computer, - explained Zaphod. - I discovered it had an emergency
back-up personality that I thought might work out better.
- Now this is going to be your ﬁrst day out on a strange new planet, -
continued Eddie’s new voice, - so I want you all wrapped up snug and warm,
and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters.
Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch.
- I’m sorry, - he said, - I think we might be better oﬀ with a slide rule.
- Right! - snapped the computer. - Who said that?
- Will you open the exit hatch please, computer? - said Zaphod trying not

independence of computers.

you with a very large axe, got that?
Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this.
Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive thing
you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and
saying Blood... blood... blood... blood...

608,What was the condition of the land that the five figures were wandering over?,"Chapter 20
Five ﬁgures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were dullish grey,
bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at. It was
like a dried-out marsh, now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of
dust about an inch thick. It was very cold.
Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked oﬀ by himself and
was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground.
The wind stung Arthur’s eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his
throat. However, the thing stung most was his mind.
- It’s fantastic... - he said, and his own voice rattled his ears. Sound carried
badly in this thin atmosphere.
- Desolate hole if you ask me, - said Ford. - I could have more fun in a cat
litter. - He felt a mounting irritation. Of all the planets in all the star systems
of all the Galaxy - didn’t he just have to turn up at a dump like this after ﬁfteen
years of being a castaway? Not even a hot dog stand in evidence. He stooped
down and picked up a cold clot of earth, but there was nothing underneath it
worth crossing thousands of light years to look at.
- No, - insisted Arthur, - don’t you understand, this is the ﬁrst time I’ve
actually stood on the surface of another planet... a whole alien world!.. Pity
it’s such a dump though.
Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have sworn she
saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when
she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a
hundred yards or so behind them.
She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod
standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join
him.
He seemed to be excited, but they couldn’t clearly hear what he was saying
because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind.
As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it
seemed to be circular - a crater about a hundred and ﬁfty yards wide. Round
the outside of the crater the sloping ground was spattered with black and red
lumps. They stopped and looked at a piece. It was wet. It was rubbery.
With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat.
At the top of the crater’s lip they met Zaphod.
- Look, - he said, pointing into the crater.
In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn’t
lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot. The silence was only disturbed

actually stood on the surface of another planet... a whole alien world!.. Pity
it’s such a dump though.
Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have sworn she
saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when
she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a
hundred yards or so behind them.
She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod
standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join
him.
He seemed to be excited, but they couldn’t clearly hear what he was saying
because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind.
As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it
seemed to be circular - a crater about a hundred and ﬁfty yards wide. Round
the outside of the crater the sloping ground was spattered with black and red
lumps. They stopped and looked at a piece. It was wet. It was rubbery.
With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat.
At the top of the crater’s lip they met Zaphod.
- Look, - he said, pointing into the crater.
In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn’t
lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot. The silence was only disturbed

by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian’s throat.
- I suppose there’s no point in trying to bury it? - murmured Arthur, and
then wished he hadn’t.
- Come, - said Zaphod and started back down into the crater.
- What, down there? - said Trillian with severe distaste.
- Yeah, - said Zaphod, - come on, I’ve got something to show you.
- We can see it, - said Trillian.
- Not that, - said Zaphod, - something else. Come on.
They all hesitated.
- Come on, - insisted Zaphod, - I’ve found a way in.
- In? - said Arthur in horror.
- Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage. The force of the
whale’s impact cracked it open, and that’s where we have to go. Where no man
has trod these ﬁve million years, into the very depths of time itself...
Marvin started his ironical humming again.
Zaphod hit him and he shut up.
With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline
into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate creator.
- Life, - said Marvin dolefully, - loathe it or ignore it, you can’t like it.
The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network of
galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails.
Zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of them, but Marvin was able
to do it rather faster. Dank air wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod
shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom.
- According to the legends, - he said, - the Magratheans lived most of their
lives underground.
- Why’s that? - said Arthur. - Did the surface become too polluted or
overpopulated?
- No, I don’t think so, - said Zaphod. - I think they just didn’t like it very
much.
- Are you sure you know what you’re doing? - said Trillian peering nervously
into the darkness. - We’ve been attacked once already you know.
- Look kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus the
four of us, so come on, let’s get on in there. Er, hey Earthman...
- Arthur, - said Arthur.
- Yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of
the passageway. OK?
- Guard? - said Arthur. - What from? You just said there’s no one here.
- Yeah, well, just for safety, OK? - said Zaphod.
- Whose? Yours or mine?
- Good lad. OK, here we go.
Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford.
- Well I hope you all have a really miserable time, - complained Arthur.
- Don’t worry, - Marvin assured him, - they will.
In a few seconds they had disappeared from view.
Arthur stamped around in a huﬀ, and then decided that a whale’s graveyard
is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in.

618,What was Zaphod's reaction upon discovering the inhabited planet Magrathea?,"93
Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying
to hide it by striding purposefully. He ﬂung the torch beam around. The walls
were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch, the air thick with decay.
- There, what did I tell you? - he said. - An inhabited planet. Magrathea, -
and he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile ﬂoor.
Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it
was less thoroughly squalid.
At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics - simple
angular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and studied one of them
but could not interpret any sense in them. She called to Zaphod.
- Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?
- I think they’re just strange symbols of some kind, - said Zaphod, hardly
glancing back.
Trillian shrugged and hurried after him.
From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish
chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment. He
dragged Zaphod into one to have a look. Trillian followed.
- Look, - said Ford, - you reckon this is Magrathea...
- Yeah, - said Zaphod, - and we heard the voice, right?
- OK, so I’ve bought the fact that it’s Magrathea - for the moment. What
you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it. You
didn’t just look it up in a star atlas, that’s for sure.
- Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky guesses. Easy.
- And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?
- I stole it to look for a lot of things.
- A lot of things? - said Ford in surprise. - Like what?
- I don’t know.
- What?
- I don’t know what I’m looking for.
- Why not?
- Because... because... I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn’t be
able to look for them.
- What, are you crazy?
- It’s a possibility I haven’t ruled out yet, - said Zaphod quietly. - I only know
as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions.
And its current conditions are not good.
For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind
suddenly full of worry.
- Listen old friend, if you want to... - started Ford eventually.
- No, wait... I’ll tell you something, - said Zaphod. - I freewheel a lot. I
get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I’ll become
President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it’s easy. I decide to steal this ship.
I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens. Yeah, I work out how it
can best be done, right, but it always works out. It’s like having a Galacticredit
card which keeps on working though you never send oﬀ the cheques. And then
whenever I stop and think why did I want to do something? - how did I work
out how to do it? - I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it.

chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment. He
dragged Zaphod into one to have a look. Trillian followed.
- Look, - said Ford, - you reckon this is Magrathea...
- Yeah, - said Zaphod, - and we heard the voice, right?
- OK, so I’ve bought the fact that it’s Magrathea - for the moment. What
you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it. You
didn’t just look it up in a star atlas, that’s for sure.
- Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky guesses. Easy.
- And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?
- I stole it to look for a lot of things.
- A lot of things? - said Ford in surprise. - Like what?
- I don’t know.
- What?
- I don’t know what I’m looking for.
- Why not?
- Because... because... I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn’t be
able to look for them.
- What, are you crazy?
- It’s a possibility I haven’t ruled out yet, - said Zaphod quietly. - I only know
as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions.
And its current conditions are not good.
For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind
suddenly full of worry.
- Listen old friend, if you want to... - started Ford eventually.
- No, wait... I’ll tell you something, - said Zaphod. - I freewheel a lot. I
get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I’ll become
President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it’s easy. I decide to steal this ship.
I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens. Yeah, I work out how it
can best be done, right, but it always works out. It’s like having a Galacticredit
card which keeps on working though you never send oﬀ the cheques. And then
whenever I stop and think why did I want to do something? - how did I work
out how to do it? - I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it.
Like I have now. It’s a big eﬀort to talk about it.
Zaphod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. Then he frowned
and said,"
623,What realization did Zaphod have about his mind not working properly?,"94 CHAPTER 20.
- Last night I was worrying about this again. About the fact that part of
my mind just didn’t seem to work properly. Then it occurred to me that the
way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas
with, without telling me about it. I put the two ideas together and decided that
maybe that somebody had locked oﬀ part of my mind for that purpose, which
was why I couldn’t use it. I wondered if there was a way I could check.
- I went to the ship’s medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelo-
graphic screen. I went through every major screening test on both my heads -
all the tests I had to go through under government medical oﬃcers before my
nomination for Presidency could be properly ratiﬁed. They showed up nothing.
Nothing unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, ir-
responsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn’t have guessed. And
no other anomalies. So I started inventing further tests, completely at random.
Nothing. Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the
results from the other head. Still nothing. Finally I got silly, because I’d given
it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia. Last thing I did before I
packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green
ﬁlter. You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when I
was a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?
Ford nodded.
- And there it was, - said Zaphod, - clear as day. A whole section in the
middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else
around them. Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically
traumatised those two lumps of cerebellum.
Ford stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white.
- Somebody did that to you? - whispered Ford.
- Yeah.
- But have you any idea who? Or why?
- Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was.
- You know? How do you know?
- Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses. They
left them there for me to see.
Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl.
- Initials? Burnt into your brain?
- Yeah.
- Well, what were they, for God’s sake?
Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he looked away.
- Z.B., - he said.
At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started
to pour into the chamber.
- I’ll tell you about it later, - choked Zaphod as all three passed out."

633,What academic fields did Veet Voojagig study at the University of Maximegalon?,"Chapter 21
On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.
Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at random.
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and
contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the
time.
One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the ex-
periences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of
Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philol-
ogy, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical per-
ception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with
Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had
happened to all the biros he’d bought over the past few years.
There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited
all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came
up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the
time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited
by humanoids, reptiloids, ﬁshoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades
of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms.
And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping
away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could
enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and
generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life.
And as theories go this was all very ﬁne and pleasant until Veet Voojagig
suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a
while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon
he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was ﬁnally sent into tax exile,
which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of
themselves in public.
When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voo-
jagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited
by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he
was later discovered to be lying.
There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Al-
tairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course
Zaphod Beeblebrox’s highly proﬁtable second-hand biro business.

634,What theory did Veet Voojagig come up with regarding the disappearance of biros?,"Chapter 21
On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.
Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at random.
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and
contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the
time.
One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the ex-
periences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of
Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philol-
ogy, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical per-
ception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with
Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had
happened to all the biros he’d bought over the past few years.
There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited
all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came
up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the
time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited
by humanoids, reptiloids, ﬁshoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades
of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms.
And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping
away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could
enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and
generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life.
And as theories go this was all very ﬁne and pleasant until Veet Voojagig
suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a
while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon
he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was ﬁnally sent into tax exile,
which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of
themselves in public.
When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voo-
jagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited
by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he
was later discovered to be lying.
There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Al-
tairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course
Zaphod Beeblebrox’s highly proﬁtable second-hand biro business.

thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later.
Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little

651,Who is the mysterious elderly man that Arthur encounters in Chapter 22?,"Chapter 22
He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of
light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was tallish, elderly and dressed
in a single long grey robe. When he turned his face was thin and distinguished,
careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he
didn’t turn yet, not even to react to Arthur’s yelp of surprise.
Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned.
His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the
source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some
kind - a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed. It shed a dim pool of light around it.
The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed.
- You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet, - he said.
- Who... who are you? - stammered Arthur.
The man looked away. Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his face.
- My name is not important, - he said.
He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was clearly some-
thing he felt he didn’t have to rush at. Arthur felt awkward.
- I... er... you startled me... - he said, lamely.
The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows.
- Hmmmm? - he said.
- I said you startled me.
- Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you.
Arthur frowned at him.
- But you shot at us! There were missiles... - he said.
The man chuckled slightly.
- An automatic system, - he said and gave a small sigh. - Ancient computers
ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages
hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think they take the occasional pot shot
to relieve the monotony.
He looked gravely at Arthur and said,
- I’m a great fan of science you know.
- Oh... er, really? - said Arthur, who was beginning to ﬁnd the man’s
curious, kindly manner disconcerting.
- Oh, yes, - said the old man, and simply stopped talking again.
- Ah, - said Arthur, - er... - He had an odd felling of being like a man in the
act of adultery who is surprised when the woman’s husband wanders into the
room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and

- An automatic system, - he said and gave a small sigh. - Ancient computers
ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages
hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think they take the occasional pot shot
to relieve the monotony.
He looked gravely at Arthur and said,
- I’m a great fan of science you know.
- Oh... er, really? - said Arthur, who was beginning to ﬁnd the man’s
curious, kindly manner disconcerting.
- Oh, yes, - said the old man, and simply stopped talking again.
- Ah, - said Arthur, - er... - He had an odd felling of being like a man in the
act of adultery who is surprised when the woman’s husband wanders into the
room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and
leaves again.

661,What event caused the inhabitants of the planet to go into a deep sleep?,"98 CHAPTER 22.
- You seem ill at ease, - said the old man with polite concern.
- Er, no... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren’t really expecting to ﬁnd
anybody about in fact. I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something...
- Dead? - said the old man. - Good gracious no, we have but slept.
- Slept? - said Arthur incredulously.
- Yes, through the economic recession you see, - said the old man, apparently
unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or
not.
- Er, economic recession?
- Well you see, ﬁve million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and
seeing that custom-made planets are something of a luxury commodity you see...
He paused and looked at Arthur.
- You know we built planets do you? - he asked solemnly.
- Well yes, - said Arthur, - I’d sort of gathered...
- Fascinating trade, - said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes,
- doing the coastlines was always my favourite. Used to have endless fun doing
the little bits in fjords... so anyway, - he said trying to ﬁnd his thread again,
- the recession came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if we just
slept through it. So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all
over.
The man stiﬂed a very slight yawn and continued.
- The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market prices you
see, so that we’d all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy
enough to aﬀord our rather expensive services.
Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this.
- That’s a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn’t it?
- Is it? - asked the old man mildly. - I’m sorry, I’m a bit out of touch.
He pointed down into the crater.
- Is that robot yours? - he said.
- No, - came a thin metallic voice from the crater, - I’m mine.
- If you’d call it a robot, - muttered Arthur. - It’s more a sort of electronic
sulking machine.
- Bring it, - said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note
of decision suddenly present in the old man’s voice. He called to Marvin who
crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn’t.
- On second thoughts, - said the old man, - leave it here. You must come
with me. Great things are afoot. - He turned towards his craft which, though
no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through
the dark.
Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning
round laboriously and trudging oﬀ down into the crater again muttering sour
nothings to himself.
- Come, - called the old man, - come now or you will be late.
- Late? - said Arthur. - What for?
- What is your name, human?
- Dent. Arthur Dent, - said Arthur.
- Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent, - said the old man, sternly. - It’s a

never been very good at them myself, but I’m told they can be very eﬀective.

slept through it. So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all
over.
The man stiﬂed a very slight yawn and continued.
- The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market prices you
see, so that we’d all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy
enough to aﬀord our rather expensive services.
Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this.
- That’s a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn’t it?
- Is it? - asked the old man mildly. - I’m sorry, I’m a bit out of touch.
He pointed down into the crater.
- Is that robot yours? - he said.
- No, - came a thin metallic voice from the crater, - I’m mine.
- If you’d call it a robot, - muttered Arthur. - It’s more a sort of electronic
sulking machine.
- Bring it, - said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note
of decision suddenly present in the old man’s voice. He called to Marvin who
crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn’t.
- On second thoughts, - said the old man, - leave it here. You must come
with me. Great things are afoot. - He turned towards his craft which, though
no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through
the dark.
Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning
round laboriously and trudging oﬀ down into the crater again muttering sour
nothings to himself.
- Come, - called the old man, - come now or you will be late.
- Late? - said Arthur. - What for?
- What is your name, human?
- Dent. Arthur Dent, - said Arthur.
- Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent, - said the old man, sternly. - It’s a
sort of threat you see. - Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes. - I’ve
never been very good at them myself, but I’m told they can be very eﬀective.
Arthur blinked at him."

Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man. The
strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the
night sky quite unsettled him.
He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights
on the instrument panel.

681,What was the misconception that both humans and dolphins had about each other's intelligence?,"Chapter 23
It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.
For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more
intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New
York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in
the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed
that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons.
Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruc-
tion of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the
danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing at-
tempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and
left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophis-
ticated attempt to do a double-backwardssomersault through a hoop whilst
whistling the ”Star Sprangled Banner”, but in fact the message was this: So
long and thanks for all the ﬁsh.
In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dol-
phins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories
running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle
experiments on man. The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted
this relationship was entirely according to these creatures’ plans.

691,What was the experience like for Arthur as the aircar plunged into a tunnel in the ground at a colossal speed?,"Chapter 24
Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light
that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night. It sped swiftly. Arthur’s
companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple
of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking
if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that.
Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the black-
ness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points. The sense of
motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving
at all.
Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds
had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them
at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be. He
peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped
in alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed
certain to be a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and
Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next thing
he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him. He
twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly
in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what
had happened.
They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed had been
their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground,
the mouth of the tunnel. The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the
tunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an
hour.
He closed his eyes in terror.
After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a
slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they
were gradually gliding to a gentle halt.
He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, threading
and weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of
converging tunnels. When they ﬁnally stopped it was in a small chamber of
curved steel. Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther
end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light. It was
irritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it
properly or tell how near or far it was. Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it
might be ultra violet.

692,What warning does Slartibartfast give Arthur before they pass through the gateway into hyperspace?,"104 CHAPTER 24.
Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes.
- Earthman, - he said, - we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea.
- How did you know I was an Earthman? - demanded Arthur.
- These things will become clear to you, - said the old man gently, - at least,
- he added with slight doubt in his voice, - clearer than they are at the moment.
He continued:
- I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not
literally exist within our planet. It is a little too... large. We are about to pass
through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you.
Arthur made nervous noises.
Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly.
- It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight.
The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur
had a fairly clear idea of what inﬁnity looked like.
It wasn’t inﬁnity in fact. Inﬁnity itself looks ﬂat and uninteresting. Looking
up into the night sky is looking into inﬁnity - distance is incomprehensible and
therefore meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything
but inﬁnite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression of inﬁnity
far better than inﬁnity itself.
Arthur’s senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense speed he
knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the
gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering
wall behind them.
The wall.
The wall deﬁed the imagination - seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so
paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond
the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man.
The wall appeared perfectly ﬂat. It would take the ﬁnest laser measuring
equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to inﬁnity, as it dropped
dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved. It met itself again
thirteen light seconds away. In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow
sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and ﬂooded with unimaginable
light.
- Welcome, - said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, trav-
elling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into
the mindboggling space, - welcome, - he said, - to our factory ﬂoor.
Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged away before
them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of
curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy
spherical shapes that hung in the space.
- This, - said Slartibartfast, - is where we make most of our planets you see.
- You mean, - said Arthur, trying to form the words, - you mean you’re
starting it all up again now?
- No no, good heavens no, - exclaimed the old man, - no, the Galaxy isn’t
nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we’ve been awakened to perform just
one extraordinary commission for very... special clients from another dimension.
It may interest you... there in the distance in front of us.

structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the only one of the many structures"

The wall deﬁed the imagination - seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so
paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond
the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man.
The wall appeared perfectly ﬂat. It would take the ﬁnest laser measuring
equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to inﬁnity, as it dropped
dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved. It met itself again
thirteen light seconds away. In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow
sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and ﬂooded with unimaginable
light.
- Welcome, - said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, trav-
elling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into
the mindboggling space, - welcome, - he said, - to our factory ﬂoor.
Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged away before
them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of
curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy
spherical shapes that hung in the space.
- This, - said Slartibartfast, - is where we make most of our planets you see.
- You mean, - said Arthur, trying to form the words, - you mean you’re
starting it all up again now?
- No no, good heavens no, - exclaimed the old man, - no, the Galaxy isn’t
nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we’ve been awakened to perform just
one extraordinary commission for very... special clients from another dimension.
It may interest you... there in the distance in front of us.
Arthur followed the old man’s ﬁnger, till he was able to pick out the ﬂoating
structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the only one of the many structures"
696,Why has the factory floor been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for special clients from another dimension?,"104 CHAPTER 24.
Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes.
- Earthman, - he said, - we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea.
- How did you know I was an Earthman? - demanded Arthur.
- These things will become clear to you, - said the old man gently, - at least,
- he added with slight doubt in his voice, - clearer than they are at the moment.
He continued:
- I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not
literally exist within our planet. It is a little too... large. We are about to pass
through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you.
Arthur made nervous noises.
Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly.
- It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight.
The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur
had a fairly clear idea of what inﬁnity looked like.
It wasn’t inﬁnity in fact. Inﬁnity itself looks ﬂat and uninteresting. Looking
up into the night sky is looking into inﬁnity - distance is incomprehensible and
therefore meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything
but inﬁnite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression of inﬁnity
far better than inﬁnity itself.
Arthur’s senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense speed he
knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the
gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering
wall behind them.
The wall.
The wall deﬁed the imagination - seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so

697,What was the subliminal impression that Arthur had about the structure he was observing?,"105
that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a sublimal
impression than anything one could put one’s ﬁnger on.
At the moment however a ﬂash of light arced through the structure and
revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within.
Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him
as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind. For a few seconds he
sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to ﬁnd
somewhere to settle down and make sense.
Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking
at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to
countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in
that direction.
The ﬂash came again, and this time there could be no doubt.

making a copy from our original blueprints.
There was a pause.

you originally... made the Earth?

called Norway?

- Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn’t have mattered so much. It was a
quite shocking cock-up.

- The mice were furious?

- Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses,

- Ah, but they hadn’t paid for it you see, had they?
- Look, - said Arthur, - would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and
went mad now?
For a while the aircar ﬂew on in awkward silence. Then the old man tried
patiently to explain.

by mice. It was destroyed ﬁve minutes before the completion of the purpose for
which it was built, and we’ve got to build another one.

- Look, sorry - are we talking about the little white furry things with the

years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak. These"

that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a sublimal
impression than anything one could put one’s ﬁnger on.
At the moment however a ﬂash of light arced through the structure and
revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within.
Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him
as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind. For a few seconds he
sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to ﬁnd
somewhere to settle down and make sense.
Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking
at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to
countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in
that direction.
The ﬂash came again, and this time there could be no doubt.
- The Earth... - whispered Arthur.
- Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact, - said Slartibartfast cheerfully. - We’re
making a copy from our original blueprints.
There was a pause.
- Are you trying to tell me, - said Arthur, slowly and with control, - that
you originally... made the Earth?
- Oh yes, - said Slartibartfast. - Did you ever go to a place... I think it was
called Norway?
- No, - said Arthur, - no, I didn’t.
- Pity, - said Slartibartfast, - that was one of mine. Won an award you know.
Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about its destruction.
- You were upset!
- Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn’t have mattered so much. It was a
quite shocking cock-up.
- Huh? - said Arthur.
- The mice were furious.
- The mice were furious?
- Oh yes, - said the old man mildly.
- Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses,
but...
- Ah, but they hadn’t paid for it you see, had they?
- Look, - said Arthur, - would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and
went mad now?
For a while the aircar ﬂew on in awkward silence. Then the old man tried
patiently to explain.
- Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run
by mice. It was destroyed ﬁve minutes before the completion of the purpose for
which it was built, and we’ve got to build another one.
Only one word registered with Arthur.
- Mice? - he said.
- Indeed Earthman.
- Look, sorry - are we talking about the little white furry things with the
cheese ﬁxation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms?
Slartibartfast coughed politely.
- Earthman, - he said, - it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech.

The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued.
- They’ve been experimenting on you I’m afraid.
Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared.
- Ah no, - he said, - I see the source of the misunderstanding now. No, look
you see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them. They
were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuﬀ. So
what happened was hat the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring
bells, run around mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning
process could be examined. From our observations of their behaviour we were
able to learn all sorts of things about our own...

thinking. Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit
of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis, - if it’s ﬁnely calculated

717,What was the purpose of the stupendous super computer built by the hyperintelligent pandimensional beings?,"Chapter 25
There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the
most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want
to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?
Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional
beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan-dimensional universe is
not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the
meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra
Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily
apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve
their problems once and for all.
And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which
was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected
up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as the existence of
rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it oﬀ.
It was the size of a small city.
Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive oﬃce, mounted
on an enormous executive desk of ﬁnest ultramahagony topped with rich ultra-
red leather. The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants
and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their
families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked
out upon a tree-lined public square.
On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with
brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the oﬃce. They were aware
that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment,
but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves
deferentially before the desk, opened their brief cases and took out their leather-
bound notebooks.
Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.
For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging
a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black
panel.
The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total
active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep.
It said:
- What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest
computer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence?

out upon a tree-lined public square.
On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with
brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the oﬃce. They were aware
that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment,
but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves
deferentially before the desk, opened their brief cases and took out their leather-
bound notebooks.
Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.
For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging
a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black
panel.
The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total
active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep.
It said:
- What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest
computer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence?
Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise.

722,"What was the original purpose of Deep Thought, the computer mentioned in the passage?","108 CHAPTER 25.
- Your task, O Computer... - began Fook.
- No, wait a minute, this isn’t right, - said Lunkwill, worried. - We distinctly
designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and we’re not making do
with second best. Deep Thought, - he addressed the computer, - are you not as
we designed you to be, the greatest most powerful computer in all time?
- I described myself as the second greatest, - intoned Deep Thought, - and
such I am.
Another worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill cleared
his throat.
- There must be some mistake, - he said, - are you not a greatest computer
than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a
millisecond?
- The Milliard Gargantubrain? - said Deep Thought with unconcealed con-
tempt. - A mere abacus - mention it not.
- And are you not, - said Fook leaning anxiously forward, - a greater analyst
than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity
which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a
ﬁve-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?
- A ﬁve-week sand blizzard? - said Deep Thought haughtily. - You ask this
of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang
itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuﬀ.
The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Then
Lunkwill leaned forward again.
- But are you not, - he said, - a more ﬁendish disputant than the Great
Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and
Indefatigable?
- The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler, - said Deep Thought
thoroughly rolling the r’s, - could talk all four legs oﬀ an Arcturan MegaDonkey
- but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.
- Then what, - asked Fook, - is the problem?
- There is no problem, - said Deep Thought with magniﬁcent ringing tones.
- I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time.
- But the second? - insisted Lunkwill. - Why do you keep saying the second?
You’re surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller are
you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the...
Contemptuous lights ﬂashed across the computer’s console.
- I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons! - he
boomed. - I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!
Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and muttered,
- I think this is getting needlessly messianic.
- You know nothing of future time, - pronounced Deep Thought, - and yet in
my teeming circuitry I can navigate the inﬁnite delta streams of future probabil-
ity and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational
parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually
to design.
Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill.
- Can we get on and ask the question? - he said.
Lunkwill motioned him to wait.

Lunkwill leaned forward again.
- But are you not, - he said, - a more ﬁendish disputant than the Great
Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and
Indefatigable?
- The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler, - said Deep Thought
thoroughly rolling the r’s, - could talk all four legs oﬀ an Arcturan MegaDonkey
- but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.
- Then what, - asked Fook, - is the problem?
- There is no problem, - said Deep Thought with magniﬁcent ringing tones.
- I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time.
- But the second? - insisted Lunkwill. - Why do you keep saying the second?
You’re surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller are
you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the...
Contemptuous lights ﬂashed across the computer’s console.
- I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons! - he
boomed. - I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!
Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and muttered,
- I think this is getting needlessly messianic.
- You know nothing of future time, - pronounced Deep Thought, - and yet in
my teeming circuitry I can navigate the inﬁnite delta streams of future probabil-
ity and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational
parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually
to design.
Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill.
- Can we get on and ask the question? - he said.
Lunkwill motioned him to wait.
- What computer is this of which you speak? - he asked."
732,What task was Deep Thought designed to perform according to the passage?,"109
- I will speak of it no further in this present time, - said Deep Thought. -
Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function. Speak.
They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself.
- O Deep Thought Computer, - he said, - the task we have designed you to
perform is this. We want you to tell us... - he paused, - ...the Answer!
- The answer? - said Deep Thought. - The answer to what?
- Life! - urged Fook.
- The Universe! - said Lunkwill.
- Everything! - they said in chorus.
Deep Thought paused for a moment’s reﬂection.
- Tricky, - he said ﬁnally.
- But can you do it?
Again, a signiﬁcant pause.
- Yes, - said Deep Thought, - I can do it.
- There is an answer? - said Fook with breathless excitement.
- A simple answer? - added Lunkwill.
- Yes, - said Deep Thought. - Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is
an answer. But, - he added, - I’ll have to think about it.
A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door ﬂew open and two
angry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan Uni-
versity burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineﬀectual ﬂunkies who tried to
bar their way.
- We demand admission! - shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a
pretty young secretary in the throat.
- Come on, - shouted the older one, - you can’t keep us out! - He pushed a
junior programmer back through the door.
- We demand that you can’t keep us out! - bawled the younger one, though
he was now ﬁrmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to
stop him.
- Who are you? - said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. - What do you
want?
- I am Majikthise! - announced the older one.
- And I demand that I am Vroomfondel! - shouted the younger one.
Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel.
- It’s alright, - he explained angrily, - you don’t need to demand that.
- Alright! - bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. - I am Vroom-
fondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid
facts!
- No we don’t! - exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. - That is precisely what
we don’t demand!
Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted,
- We don’t demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid
facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!
- But who the devil are you? - exclaimed an outraged Fook.
- We, - said Majikthise, - are Philosophers.
- Though we may not be, - said Vroomfondel waving a warning ﬁnger at the
programmers.
- Yes we are, - insisted Majikthise. - We are quite deﬁnitely here as repre-
sentatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and
Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine oﬀ, and we want it oﬀ now!"

- The Universe! - said Lunkwill.
- Everything! - they said in chorus.
Deep Thought paused for a moment’s reﬂection.
- Tricky, - he said ﬁnally.
- But can you do it?
Again, a signiﬁcant pause.
- Yes, - said Deep Thought, - I can do it.
- There is an answer? - said Fook with breathless excitement.
- A simple answer? - added Lunkwill.
- Yes, - said Deep Thought. - Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is
an answer. But, - he added, - I’ll have to think about it.
A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door ﬂew open and two
angry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan Uni-
versity burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineﬀectual ﬂunkies who tried to
bar their way.
- We demand admission! - shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a
pretty young secretary in the throat.
- Come on, - shouted the older one, - you can’t keep us out! - He pushed a
junior programmer back through the door.
- We demand that you can’t keep us out! - bawled the younger one, though
he was now ﬁrmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to
stop him.
- Who are you? - said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. - What do you
want?
- I am Majikthise! - announced the older one.
- And I demand that I am Vroomfondel! - shouted the younger one.
Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel.
- It’s alright, - he explained angrily, - you don’t need to demand that.
- Alright! - bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. - I am Vroom-
fondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid
facts!
- No we don’t! - exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. - That is precisely what
we don’t demand!
Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted,
- We don’t demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid
facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!
- But who the devil are you? - exclaimed an outraged Fook.
- We, - said Majikthise, - are Philosophers.
- Though we may not be, - said Vroomfondel waving a warning ﬁnger at the
programmers.
- Yes we are, - insisted Majikthise. - We are quite deﬁnitely here as repre-
sentatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and
Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine oﬀ, and we want it oﬀ now!"
742,What is the main problem discussed by Lunkwill and Majikthise in the passage?,"110 CHAPTER 25.
- What’s the problem? - said Lunkwill.
- I’ll tell you what the problem is mate, - said Majikthise, - demarcation,
that’s the problem!
- We demand, - yelled Vroomfondel, - that demarcation may or may not be
the problem!
- You just let the machines get on with the adding up, - warned Majikthise,
- and we’ll take care of the eternal verities thank you very much. You want
to check your legal position you do mate. Under law the Quest for Ultimate
Truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any
bloody machine goes and actually ﬁnds it and we’re straight out of a job aren’t
we? I mean what’s the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there
may or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his bleeding
phone number the next morning?
- That’s right! - shouted Vroomfondel, - we demand rigidly deﬁned areas of
doubt and uncertainty!
Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room.
- Might I make an observation at this point? - inquired Deep Thought.
- We’ll go on strike! - yelled Vroomfondel.
- That’s right! - agreed Majikthise. - You’ll have a national Philosopher’s
strike on your hands!
The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver
units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the
room, cut in to give Deep Thought’s voice a little more power.
- All I wanted to say, - bellowed the computer, - is that my circuits are now
irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of
Life, the Universe, and Everything - he paused and satisﬁed himself that he now
had everyone’s attention, before continuing more quietly, - but the programme
will take me a little while to run.
Fook glanced impatiently at his watch.
- How long? - he said.
- Seven and a half million years, - said Deep Thought.
Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.
- Seven and a half million years!.. - they cried in chorus.
- Yes, - declaimed Deep Thought, - I said I’d have to think about it, didn’t
I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create
an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in
general. Everyone’s going to have their own theories about what answer I’m
eventually to come up with, and who better to capitalize on that media market
than you yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently
enough and slagging each other oﬀ in the popular press, you can keep yourself
on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?
The two philosophers gaped at him.
- Bloody hell, - said Majikthise, - now that is what I call thinking. Here
Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?
- Dunno, - said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, - think our brains must be
too highly trained Majikthise.
So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a
lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams."

- I’ll tell you what the problem is mate, - said Majikthise, - demarcation,
that’s the problem!
- We demand, - yelled Vroomfondel, - that demarcation may or may not be
the problem!
- You just let the machines get on with the adding up, - warned Majikthise,
- and we’ll take care of the eternal verities thank you very much. You want
to check your legal position you do mate. Under law the Quest for Ultimate
Truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any
bloody machine goes and actually ﬁnds it and we’re straight out of a job aren’t
we? I mean what’s the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there
may or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his bleeding
phone number the next morning?
- That’s right! - shouted Vroomfondel, - we demand rigidly deﬁned areas of
doubt and uncertainty!
Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room.
- Might I make an observation at this point? - inquired Deep Thought.
- We’ll go on strike! - yelled Vroomfondel.
- That’s right! - agreed Majikthise. - You’ll have a national Philosopher’s
strike on your hands!
The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver
units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the
room, cut in to give Deep Thought’s voice a little more power.
- All I wanted to say, - bellowed the computer, - is that my circuits are now
irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of
Life, the Universe, and Everything - he paused and satisﬁed himself that he now
had everyone’s attention, before continuing more quietly, - but the programme
will take me a little while to run.
Fook glanced impatiently at his watch.
- How long? - he said.
- Seven and a half million years, - said Deep Thought.
Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.
- Seven and a half million years!.. - they cried in chorus.
- Yes, - declaimed Deep Thought, - I said I’d have to think about it, didn’t
I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create
an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in
general. Everyone’s going to have their own theories about what answer I’m
eventually to come up with, and who better to capitalize on that media market
than you yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently
enough and slagging each other oﬀ in the popular press, you can keep yourself
on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?
The two philosophers gaped at him.
- Bloody hell, - said Majikthise, - now that is what I call thinking. Here
Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?
- Dunno, - said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, - think our brains must be
too highly trained Majikthise.
So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a
lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams."
752,What did Arthur find confusing about the story that Slartibartfast told him?,"Chapter 26

you would care to discover what happened seven and a half millions later, on
the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you to my study where you can
experience the events yourself on our Sens-O-Tape records. That is unless you
would care to take a quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It’s only half
completed I’m afraid - we haven’t even ﬁnished burying the artiﬁcial dinosaur
skeletons in the crust yet, then we have the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods

Slartibartfast’s study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public
library. The old man frowned as they stepped in.
- Terribly unfortunate, - he said, - a diode blew in one of the life-support
computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staﬀ we discovered they’d been
dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who’s going to clear away the bodies,
that’s what I want to know. Look why don’t you sit yourself down over there
and let me plug you in?
He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out
of the rib cage of a stegosaurus.
- It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus, - explained the old man
as he pottered about ﬁshing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper
and drawing instruments. - Here, - he said, - hold these, - and passed a couple
of stripped wire end to Arthur.
The instant he took hold of them a bird ﬂew straight through him.
He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. Beneath him
was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see
were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse
for wear - many were cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was
shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation
that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact
that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited
people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured ﬂags were ﬂuttering
in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.
Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so
much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reﬂect on this a voice
rang out across the square and called for everyone’s attention.
A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly
dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy.
- O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought! - he cried out. -
Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most
Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The Time of Waiting
is over!
Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and wolf whistles
sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled
over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air.
- Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and
Hopefully Enlightening Day! - cried the cheer leader. - The Day of the Answer!

shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation
that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact
that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited
people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured ﬂags were ﬂuttering
in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.
Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so
much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reﬂect on this a voice
rang out across the square and called for everyone’s attention.
A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly
dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy.
- O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought! - he cried out. -
Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most
Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The Time of Waiting
is over!
Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and wolf whistles
sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled
over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air.
- Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and
Hopefully Enlightening Day! - cried the cheer leader. - The Day of the Answer!

Slartibartfast’s study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public
library. The old man frowned as they stepped in.
- Terribly unfortunate, - he said, - a diode blew in one of the life-support
computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staﬀ we discovered they’d been
dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who’s going to clear away the bodies,
that’s what I want to know. Look why don’t you sit yourself down over there
and let me plug you in?
He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out
of the rib cage of a stegosaurus.
- It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus, - explained the old man
as he pottered about ﬁshing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper
and drawing instruments. - Here, - he said, - hold these, - and passed a couple
of stripped wire end to Arthur.
The instant he took hold of them a bird ﬂew straight through him.
He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. Beneath him
was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see
were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse
for wear - many were cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was
shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation
that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact

772,What was the crowd's reaction to the speaker's announcement in the beginning of the passage?,"114 CHAPTER 27.
Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd.
- Never again, - cried the man, - never again will we wake up in the morning
and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically
speaking, matter if I don’t get up and go to work? For today we will ﬁnally
learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little
problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!
As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the
air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the
building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd.
He experienced a moment’s panic as he sailed straight through towards the
window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right
through the solid glass without apparently touching it.
No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly sur-
prising as he wasn’t there. He began to realize that the whole experience was
merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a
cocked hat.
The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and a half
million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century
or so. The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded
now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk’s leather
top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday.
Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited.
- The time is nearly upon us, - said one, and Arthur was surprised to see
a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man’s neck. The word was
Loonquawl, and it ﬂashed a couple of times and the disappeared again. Before
Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg
appeared by his neck.
- Seventy-ﬁve thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in
motion, - the second man said, - and in all that time we will be the ﬁrst to hear
the computer speak.
- An awesome prospect, Phouchg, - agreed the ﬁrst man, and Arthur sud-
denly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles.
- We are the ones who will hear, - said Phouchg, - the answer to the great
question of Life!..
- The Universe!.. - said Loonquawl.
- And Everything!..
- Shhh, - said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, - I think Deep Thought is
preparing to speak!
There was a moment’s expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on
the front of the console. Lights ﬂashed on and oﬀ experimentally and settled
down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication
channel.
- Good morning, - said Deep Thought at last.
- Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought, - said Loonquawl nervously, - do
you have... er, that is...
- An answer for you? - interrupted Deep Thought majestically. - Yes. I
have.
The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.

the front of the console. Lights ﬂashed on and oﬀ experimentally and settled
down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication
channel.
- Good morning, - said Deep Thought at last.
- Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought, - said Loonquawl nervously, - do
you have... er, that is...
- An answer for you? - interrupted Deep Thought majestically. - Yes. I
have.
The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.
- There really is one? - breathed Phouchg.
- There really is one, - conﬁrmed Deep Thought."
781,What was the first thing Deep Thought said when it finally spoke?,"114 CHAPTER 27.
Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd.
- Never again, - cried the man, - never again will we wake up in the morning
and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically
speaking, matter if I don’t get up and go to work? For today we will ﬁnally
learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little
problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!
As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the
air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the
building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd.
He experienced a moment’s panic as he sailed straight through towards the
window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right
through the solid glass without apparently touching it.
No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly sur-
prising as he wasn’t there. He began to realize that the whole experience was
merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a
cocked hat.
The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and a half
million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century
or so. The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded
now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk’s leather
top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday.
Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited.
- The time is nearly upon us, - said one, and Arthur was surprised to see
a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man’s neck. The word was
Loonquawl, and it ﬂashed a couple of times and the disappeared again. Before
Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg
appeared by his neck.
- Seventy-ﬁve thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in
motion, - the second man said, - and in all that time we will be the ﬁrst to hear
the computer speak.
- An awesome prospect, Phouchg, - agreed the ﬁrst man, and Arthur sud-
denly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles.
- We are the ones who will hear, - said Phouchg, - the answer to the great
question of Life!..
- The Universe!.. - said Loonquawl.
- And Everything!..
- Shhh, - said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, - I think Deep Thought is
preparing to speak!
There was a moment’s expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on

puter whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate - and
yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to
the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such inﬁnite and subtle complexity that
organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves
shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-
million-year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall
name it also unto you. And it shall be called... The Earth.

- He got a double dose of the gas, - said Trillian looking down at him, - two

- And stop talking, - said Zaphod, - it’s hard enough trying to sleep anyway.
What’s the matter with the ground? It’s all cold and hard.
- It’s gold, - said Ford.
With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and scanning the
horizon, because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every direction,
perfectly smooth and solid. It gleamed like... it’s impossible to say what it
gleamed like because nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way that
a planet of solid gold does.
- Who put all that there? - yelped Zaphod, goggle-eyed.
- Don’t get excited, - said Ford, - it’s only a catalogue.
- A who?
- A catalogue, - said Trillian, - an illusion.
- How can you say that? - cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and knees and
staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it with his ﬁngernail. It was
very heavy and very slightly soft - he could mark it with his ﬁngernail. It was
very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated
oﬀ it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates oﬀ solid gold.
- Trillian and I came round a while ago, - said Ford. - We shouted and yelled
till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed
up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to
deal with us. This is all Sens-O-Tape.

oﬀ it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates oﬀ solid gold.
- Trillian and I came round a while ago, - said Ford. - We shouted and yelled
till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed
up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to
deal with us. This is all Sens-O-Tape.
Zaphod stared at him bitterly.
- Ah, shit, - he said, - you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream
to show me somebody else’s. - He sat down in a huﬀ.
- What’s that series of valleys over there? - he said.

Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked.
- Very pretty, - said Zaphod petulantly.
In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It ﬂickered and changed,
and when they looked around again so had the land.
As with one voice they all went, - Yuch.
The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow
and green pebbles - presumably terribly precious stones. The mountains in the
distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks. Nearby stood a solid silver
beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassles.
In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It said,
Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not proud.

And I did it in such a way that it wouldn’t be detected by the government
screening tests. And I wasn’t to know anything about it myself. Pretty crazy,
right?
The other two nodded in agreement.
- So I reckon, what’s so secret that I can’t let anybody know I know it, not
the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is I don’t know.
Obviously. But I put a few things together and I can begin to guess. When
did I decide to run for President? Shortly after the death of President Yooden
Vranx. You remember Yooden, Ford?
- Yeah, - said Ford, - he was that guy we met when we were kids, the
Arcturan captain. He was a gas. He gave us conkers when you bust your way
into his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing kid he’d ever met.
- What’s all this? - said Trillian.
- Ancient history, - said Ford, - when we were kids together on Betelgeuse.
The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the
Galactic Centre and the outlying regions The Betelgeuse trading scouts used
to ﬁnd the markets and the Arcturans would supply them. There was a lot of
trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and
the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields
known to Galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and huge. In orbit
round a planet they would eclipse the sun.

- Just before Yooden died he came to see me.
- What? You never told me.
- No.
- What did he say? What did he come to see you about?
- He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should steal it.
- His idea?
- Yeah, - said Zaphod, - and the only possible way of stealing it was to be
at the launching ceremony.
Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with
laughter.
- Are you telling me, - he said, - that you set yourself up to become President
of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?
- That’s it, - said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people
locked away in a room with soft walls.
- But why? - said Ford. - What’s so important about having it?
- Dunno, - said Zaphod, - I think if I’d consciously known what was so
important about it and what I would need it for it would have showed up on
the brain screening tests and I would never have passed. I think Yooden told
me a lot of things that are still locked away.
- So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result
of Yooden talking to you?
- He was a hell of a talker.
- Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you know.
Zaphod shrugged.
- I mean, don’t you have any inkling of the reasons for all this? asked Ford.
Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his minds.
- No, - he said at last, - I don’t seem to be letting myself into any of my
secrets. Still, - he added on further reﬂection, - I can understand that. I wouldn’t
trust myself further than I could spit a rat.

on him not doing it, and didn’t want him coming back with fake evidence. So
what happens? We got in his tri-jet which he had souped up into something
totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into
a megafreighter I still don’t know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy
pistols and demanded conkers. A wilder thing I have not known. Lost me a
year’s pocket money. For what? Conkers.
- The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx, - said Zaphod. -
He gave us food, booze - stuﬀ from really weird parts of the Galaxy - lots of
conkers of course, and we had just the most incredible time. Then he teleported
us back. Into the maximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison. He was a
cool guy. Went on to become President of the Galaxy.
Zaphod paused.
The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark mists
swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows.
The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other
illusory beings. Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to
make it a paying proposition.
- Ford, - said Zaphod quietly.
- Yeah?
- Just before Yooden died he came to see me.

- No.

attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study. He picked up a
paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn’t think of anywhere else to put it,
so he but it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over. - Deep
Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it.
- And the Vogons came and destroyed it ﬁve minutes before the program
was completed, - added Arthur, not unbitterly.
- Yes, - said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room. -
Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that. Ten million years,
Earthman... can you conceive of that kind of time span? A galactic civilization
could grow from a single worm ﬁve times over in that time. Gone. - He paused.
- Well that’s bureaucracy for you, - he added.
- You know, - said Arthur thoughtfully, - all this explains a lot of things. All
through my life I’ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was
going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me
what it was.
- No, - said the old man, - that’s just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone
in the Universe has that.
- Everyone? - said Arthur. - Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means
something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know...
- Maybe. Who cares? - said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. -
Perhaps I’m old and tired, - he continued, - but I always think that the chances
of ﬁnding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing
to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me:
I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway.
He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block
with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it.
- Where’s the sense in that? - he said. - None that I’ve been able to make
out. I’ve been doing fjords in all my life. For a ﬂeeting moment they become
fashionable and I get a major award.
He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly,
but not so carelessly that it didn’t land on something soft.
- In this replacement Earth we’re building they’ve given me Africa to do
and of course I’m doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them,
and I’m old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a
continent. And they tell me it’s not equatorial enough. Equatorial! - He gave

- What were the ﬁrst two?
- Oh, probably just coincidences, - said Slartibartfast carelessly. He opened
the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow.
Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the
sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning.
- I seem to be having tremendous diﬃculty with my lifestyle, - he muttered
to himself.
- I beg your pardon? - said the old man mildly.
- Oh nothing, - said Arthur, - only joking."
850,What was the consequence of Arthur's seemingly harmless comment about his lifestyle in the distant Galaxy?,"Chapter 31
It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the
problem is not always appreciated.
For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said - I seem to be having
tremendous diﬃculty with my lifestyle, - a freak wormhole opened up in the
fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far far back in time
across almost inﬁnite reaches of space to a distant Galaxy where strange and
warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle.
The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time.
A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the
Vl’hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the
G’Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling
steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised
to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile
creature to take back what it had said about his mother.
The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment
the words I seem to be having tremendous diﬃculty with my lifestyle drifted
across the conference table.
Unfortunately, in the Vl’hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imag-
inable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries.
Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a few
thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake,
and so the two opposing battle ﬂeets settled their few remaining diﬀerences in
order to launch a joint attack on our own Galaxy - now positively identiﬁed as
the source of the oﬀending remark.
For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of
space and ﬁnally dived screaming on to the ﬁrst planet they came across - which
happened to be the Earth - where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the
entire battle ﬂeet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.
Those who study the complex interplay of cause and eﬀect in the history of
the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are
powerless to prevent it.
- It’s just life, - they say.
A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a doorway.
They left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass-
topped tables and perspex awards. Almost immediately, a light ﬂashed above
the door at the other side of the room and they entered.
- Arthur! You’re safe! - a voice cried.

851,Who are the characters sitting around the table enjoying a meal in the passage?,"126 CHAPTER 31.
- Am I? - said Arthur, rather startled. - Oh good.
The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see
Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out
with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits. They were stuﬃng
their faces.
- What happened to you? - demanded Arthur.
- Well, - said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, - our guests here
have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have
now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us. Here, he said hoiking out a
lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl, - have some Vegan Rhino’s cutlet. It’s
delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing.
- Hosts? - said Arthur. - What hosts? I don’t see any...
A small voice said,
- Welcome to lunch, Earth creature.
Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped.
- Ugh! - he said. - There are mice on the table!
There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur.
He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like whisky
glasses on the table. He heard the silence and glanced around at everyone.
- Oh! - he said, with sudden realization. - Oh, I’m sorry, I wasn’t quite
prepared for...
- Let me introduce you, - said Trillian. - Arthur this is Benji mouse.
- Hi, - said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have been a
touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass like aﬀair, and it moved
forward slightly.
- And this is Frankie mouse.
The other mouse said, - Pleased to meet you, - and did likewise.
Arthur gaped.
- But aren’t they...
- Yes, - said Trillian, - they are the mice I brought with me from the Earth.
She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned
shrug.
- Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey? - she said.
Slartibartfast coughed politely.
- Er, excuse me, - he said.
- Yes, thank you Slartibartfast, - said Benji mouse sharply, - you may go.
- What? Oh... er, very well, - said the old man, slightly taken aback, - I’ll
just go and get on with some of my fjords then.
- Ah, well in fact that won’t be necessary, - said Frankie mouse. - It looks
very much as if we won’t be needing the new Earth any longer. - He swivelled
his pink little eyes. - Not now that we have found a native of the planet who
was there seconds before it was destroyed.
- What? - cried Slartibartfast, aghast. - You can’t mean that! I’ve got a
thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!
- Well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle
them, - said Frankie, acidly.
- Skiing holiday! - cried the old man. - Those glaciers are works of art!
Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines!
It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!
- Thank you Slartibartfast, - said Benji ﬁrmly. - That will be all."

million years in order to ﬁnd this wretched thing called the Ultimate Question.

- No - we already thought of that one, - said Frankie interrupting, - but it
doesn’t ﬁt the answer. Why? - Forty-Two... you see, it doesn’t work.
- No, - said Arthur, - I mean why have you been doing it?
- Oh, I see, - said Frankie. - Well, eventually just habit I think, to be
brutally honest. And this is more or less the point - we’re sick to the teeth with
the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those
whinnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you
know what I mean? It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I ﬁnished
our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since
manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good oﬃces of your friends.
- Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension, - put in Benji.
- Since when, - continued his murine colleague, - we have had an oﬀer of a
quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and lecture circuit back

it.

Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to.

see.

generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right up

- So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate conﬁguration of the
computer programme, - said Ford, rather lucidly he thought.

- Well, - said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn’t aware of ever having felt an
organic part of anything. He had always seen this as one of his problems.

Arthur, - there’s a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in
the structure of your brain - so we want to buy it oﬀ you.

important.
- Yes, an electronic brain, - said Frankie, - a simple one would suﬃce.
- A simple one! - wailed Arthur.
- Yeah, - said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, - you’d just have to program
it to say What? and I don’t understand and Where’s the tea? - who’d know
the diﬀerence?
- What? - cried Arthur, backing away still further.
- See what I mean? - said Zaphod and howled with pain because of something
that Trillian did at that moment.

Ford made for the door.

vanishing fro their piping little voices in an instant. With a tiny whining shriek

where they lay shattered on the ﬂoor.
- Damnation, - muttered Frankie mouse, - all that fuss over two pounds of
Earthling brain. - He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes ﬂashing, his ﬁne
white coat bristling with static.
- The only thing we can do now, - said Benji, crouching and stroking his
whiskers in thought, - is to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound
plausible.
- Diﬃcult, - said Frankie. He thought. - How about What’s yellow and
dangerous?
Benji considered this for a moment.
- No, no good, - he said. - Doesn’t ﬁt the answer.
They sank into silence for a few seconds.
- Alright, - said Benji. - What do you get if you multiply six by seven?
- No, no, too literal, too factual, - said Frankie, - wouldn’t sustain the
punters’ interest.
Again they thought.

- Here’s a thought. How many roads must a man walk down?
- Ah, - said Benji. - Aha, now that does sound promising! - He rolled the
phrase around a little. - Yes, - he said, - that’s excellent! Sounds very signiﬁcant
without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all. How many roads
must a man walk down? Forty-two. Excellent, excellent, that’ll fox ’em. Frankie
baby, we are made!
They performed a scampering dance in their excitement.
Near them on the ﬂoor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about
the head with some heavy design awards.
Half a mile away, four ﬁgures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out.
They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay. They glanced about wildly.
- Which way do you reckon Zaphod? - said Ford.
- At a wild guess, I’d say down here, - said Zaphod, running oﬀ down to the

air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall.

then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!
- And I write novels! - chimed in the other cop. - Though I haven’t had any
of them published yet, so I better warn you, I’m in a meeeean mood!
Ford’s eyes popped halfway out of their sockets.
- Who are these guys? - he said.
- Dunno, - said Zaphod, - I think I preferred it when they were shooting.
- So are you going to come quietly, - shouted one of the cops again, - or are
you going to let us blast you out?
- Which would you prefer? - shouted Ford."
900,How does Ford respond to the cop's statement about their difficulties as cops?,"132 CHAPTER 32.
A voice on a loud hailer said,
- OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there. We’ve got you covered.
- Cops! - hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch. - You want to try a
guess at all, Ford?
- OK, this way, - said Ford, and the four of them ran down a gangway
between two computer banks.
At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and spacesuited
ﬁgure waving a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun.
- We don’t want to shoot you, Beeblebrox! - shouted the ﬁgure.
- Suits me ﬁne! - shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between
two data process units.
The others swerved in behind him.
- There are two of them, - said Trillian. - We’re cornered.
They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data
bank and the wall.
They held their breath and waited.
Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened ﬁre on
them simultaneously.
- Hey, they’re shooting at us, - said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, - I
thought they said they didn’t want to do that.
- Yeah, I thought they said that, - agreed Ford.
Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment.
- Hey, - he said, - I thought you said you didn’t want to shoot us! - and
ducked again.
They waited.
After a moment a voice replied, - It isn’t easy being a cop!
- What did he say? - whispered Ford in astonishment.
- He said it isn’t easy being a cop.
- Well surely that’s his problem isn’t it?
- I’d have thought so.
Ford shouted out,
- Hey listen! I think we’ve got enough problems on our own having you
shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think
we’d all ﬁnd it easier to cope!
Another pause, and then the loud hailer again.
- Now see here, guy, - said the voice on the loud hailer, - you’re not dealing
with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy
eyes and no conversation, we’re a couple of intelligent caring guys that you’d

interesting and humane! Now either you all give yourselves up now and let
us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are ﬁrmly
opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one
or two others we noticed on our way out here!

But the end never came, at least not then.
Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was
punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds.
The four stared at each other.
- What happened? - said Arthur.
- They stopped, - said Zaphod with a shrug.
- Why?
- Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?
- No.
They waited.
- Hello? - called out Ford.
No answer.
- That’s odd.
- Perhaps it’s a trap.
- They haven’t the wit.
- What were those thuds?
- Dunno.
They waited for a few more seconds.
- Right, - said Ford, - I’m going to have a look.
He glanced round at the others.
- Is no one going to say, No you can’t possibly, let me go instead?
They all shook their heads.
- Oh well, - he said, and stood up.
For a moment, nothing happened.
Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford peered
through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer.
Cautiously he stepped out into the open.
Still nothing happened.
Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space-suited
ﬁgure of one of the cops. He was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground. Twenty
yards in the other direction lay the second man. No one else was anywhere to
be seen.
This struck Ford as being extremely odd.
Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the ﬁrst one. The body lay reassuringly
still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it
and put his foot down on the Kill-O-Zap gun that still dangled from its limp
ﬁngers.

Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was
punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds.
The four stared at each other.

- Why?
- Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?
- No.
They waited.

No answer.
- That’s odd.
- Perhaps it’s a trap.
- They haven’t the wit.
- What were those thuds?
- Dunno.
They waited for a few more seconds.

He glanced round at the others.
- Is no one going to say, No you can’t possibly, let me go instead?
They all shook their heads.
- Oh well, - he said, and stood up.
For a moment, nothing happened.
Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford peered
through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer.
Cautiously he stepped out into the open.
Still nothing happened.

921,What was the cop's origin and what type of atmosphere did he require to survive?,"136 CHAPTER 33.
He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance.
The cop was quite clearly dead.
A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa - he was a
methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin
oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea.
The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpect-
edly to have blown up.
Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These miniature suit
computers usually had the full back-up of the main computer back on the ship,
with which they were directly linked through the sub-etha. Such a system was
fail-safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was
unheard of.
He hurried over to the other prone ﬁgure, and discovered that exactly the
same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously.
He called the others over to look. They came, shared his astonishment, but
not his curiosity.
- Let’s get shot out of this hole, - said Zaphod. - If whatever I’m supposed
to be looking for is here, I don’t want it. - He grabbed the second Kill-O-Zap
gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the
corridor, followed by the others. He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar
that stood waiting for them a few yards away.
The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to Slartibart-
fast.
It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel. The
note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls.
It said, This is probably the best button to press."

926,What is the significance of R17 in the context of the aircar's speed?,"Chapter 34
The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels
that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the
grip of yet another drear morning twilight. Ghastly grey lights congealed on
the land.
R is a velocity measure, deﬁned as a reasonable speed of travel that is con-
sistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say ﬁve minutes
late. It is therefore clearly an almost inﬁnitely variable ﬁgure according to cir-
cumstances, since the ﬁrst two factors vary not only with speed taken as an
absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tran-
quility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death.
R17 is not a ﬁxed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.
The aircar ﬂung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next
to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached
bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had
come, presumably on important business of its own.
Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship.
Beside it stood another one.
It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike aﬀair, slate green
in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size
and unfriendliness. The letters informed anyone who cared to read them as
to where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and
where the power feeds should be connected.
It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two-
man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a smoke-ﬁlled chamber
several miles beneath the ground. It is one of those curious things that is
impossible to explain or deﬁne, but one can sense when a ship is completely
dead.
Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious - a ship and two policemen
seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his experience the Universe simply
didn’t work like that.
The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even
more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suﬀering from an acute attack of
no curiosity.

tripped over an inert steel ﬁgure lying face down in the cold dust.

That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between
itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree
on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic
Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters
arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to ﬂip through Ford’s copy of The
Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Since he was going to live in the place, he
reasoned, he’d better start ﬁnding out something about it.

eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question
Where shall we have lunch?
He got no further before the ship’s intercom buzzed into life.
- Hey Earthman? You hungry kid? - said Zaphod’s voice.
- Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose, - said Arthur.
