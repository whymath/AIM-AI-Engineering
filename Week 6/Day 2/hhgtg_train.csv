39,What is the significance of the small unregarded yellow sun in the context of the story?,"Chapter 0
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western
spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly
insigniﬁcant little blue green planet whose apedescended life forms are so amaz-
ingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the
people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were
suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the
movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it
wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of
them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake
in coming down from the trees in the ﬁrst place. And some said that even the
trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been
nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a
change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly
realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she ﬁnally
knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a
terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its conse-
quences.
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible
catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the
great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard
either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one
- more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than
Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon
Colluphid’s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some
7",The small unregarded yellow sun is significant in the context of the story as it is the star around which the insignificant little blue green planet orbits.

The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its
own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remark-
able house by any means - it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish,
made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion
which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur
Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He
had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London
because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark
haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him
most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so
worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends
was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of
his friends worked in advertising.
It hadn’t properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock
down his house and build an bypass instead.
At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke
up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a
bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped oﬀ to the bathroom to wash.

The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its
own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remark-
able house by any means - it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish,
made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion
which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur
Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He
had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London
because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark
haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him
most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so
worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends
was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of

Mr. L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the
tum and a predilection for little fur hats.
He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man.
Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone
seriously wrong with his job - which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got
cleared out of the way before the day was out.
- Come oﬀ it, Mr. Dent, - he said, - you can’t win you know. You can’t lie
in front of the bulldozer indeﬁnitely. - He tried to make his eyes blaze ﬁercely
but they just wouldn’t do it.
Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.
- I’m game, - he said, - we’ll see who rusts ﬁrst.
- I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it, - said Mr. Prosser gripping
his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, - this bypass has got to be
built and it’s going to be built!
- First I’ve heard of it, - said Arthur, - why’s it going to be built?
Mr. Prosser shook his ﬁnger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away
again.
- What do you mean, why’s it got to be built? - he said. - It’s a bypass.
You’ve got to build bypasses.
Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point
B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People
living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder
what’s so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to
get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people of point A
are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for
all work out where the hell they wanted to be.
Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular,
it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He
would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend
a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point
D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t","Mr. Prosser faced an internal conflict between his desired location to live, which was at point D, and his wife's preference for climbing roses. He envisioned a nice little cottage at point D with axes over the door, while his wife wanted climbing roses. This conflict highlights the differing priorities and desires between Mr. Prosser and his wife in terms of their ideal living situation."
69,What was Arthur Dent's reaction when he found out that a workman had come to demolish his house?,"11
know why - he just liked axes. He ﬂushed hotly under the derisive grins of the
bulldozer drivers.
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on
each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to
God it wasn’t him.
Mr. Prosser said:
- You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appro-
priate time you know.
- Appropriate time? - hooted Arthur. - Appropriate time? The ﬁrst I knew
about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d
come to clean the windows and he said no he’d come to demolish the house.
He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of
windows and charged me a ﬁver. Then he told me.
- But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning oﬃce
for the last nine month.
- Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday
afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them
had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.
- But the plans were on display...
- On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to ﬁnd them.
- That’s the display department.
- With a torch.
- Ah, well the lights had probably gone.
- So had the stairs.
- But look, you found the notice didn’t you?
- Yes, - said Arthur, - yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked
ﬁling cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware
of the Leopard.
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay
propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s
house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it.
- It’s not as if it’s a particularly nice house, - he said.
- I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.
- You’ll like the bypass.
- Oh shut up, - said Arthur Dent. - Shut up and go away, and take your
bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.
Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was
for a moment ﬁlled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur
Dent’s house being consumed with ﬁre and Arthur himself running screaming
from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.
Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel
very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.
- Mr. Dent, - he said.
- Hello? Yes? - said Arthur.
- Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage
that bulldozer would suﬀer if I just let it roll straight over you?
- How much? - said Arthur.
- None at all, - said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously oﬀ wondering why
his brain was ﬁlled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.","Arthur Dent's reaction when he found out that a workman had come to demolish his house was one of shock and disbelief. He was taken by surprise and felt that the situation was handled poorly, as he was not informed beforehand about the demolition plans. He expressed his frustration and anger towards Mr. Prosser, the bulldozer driver, and the situation in general."

his brain was ﬁlled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.",Arthur Dent responded by asking Mr. Prosser how much damage the bulldozer would suffer if it rolled over him. Mr. Prosser then replied that the bulldozer would suffer none at all.

know why - he just liked axes. He ﬂushed hotly under the derisive grins of the
bulldozer drivers.
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on
each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to
God it wasn’t him.
Mr. Prosser said:
- You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appro-
priate time you know.
- Appropriate time? - hooted Arthur. - Appropriate time? The ﬁrst I knew
about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d
come to clean the windows and he said no he’d come to demolish the house.
He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of
windows and charged me a ﬁver. Then he told me.
- But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning oﬃce
for the last nine month.
- Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday
afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them
had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.
- But the plans were on display...
- On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to ﬁnd them.
- That’s the display department.
- With a torch.
- Ah, well the lights had probably gone.
- So had the stairs.
- But look, you found the notice didn’t you?
- Yes, - said Arthur, - yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked
ﬁling cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware
of the Leopard.
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay
propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s
house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it.
- It’s not as if it’s a particularly nice house, - he said.
- I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.
- You’ll like the bypass.
- Oh shut up, - said Arthur Dent. - Shut up and go away, and take your
bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.
Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was
for a moment ﬁlled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur
Dent’s house being consumed with ﬁre and Arthur himself running screaming
from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.
Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel
very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.
- Mr. Dent, - he said.
- Hello? Yes? - said Arthur.
- Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage
that bulldozer would suﬀer if I just let it roll straight over you?
- How much? - said Arthur.
- None at all, - said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously oﬀ wondering why
his brain was ﬁlled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.","Some of the challenges faced by Arthur Dent in dealing with the situation regarding his house and the bypass included not being informed about the demolition plans, difficulty in finding the plans which were hidden in a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory, and facing off against Mr. Prosser who was determined to proceed with the bypass construction."
79,What was the name chosen by Ford Prefect to blend into Earth society?,"12 CHAPTER 1.
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-
descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended
from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse
and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.
This friend of his had ﬁrst arrived on the planet some ﬁfteen Earth years
previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society - with,
it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those ﬁfteen years
pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit
on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to
choose the name ”Ford Prefect” as being nicely inconspicuous.
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicu-
ously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from
the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There
was something very slightly odd about him, but it was diﬃcult to say what
it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn’t blink often enough and when you
talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on
his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people
the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but
a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he
would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun
of any astrophysicist he could ﬁnd till he got thrown out.
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into
the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he
would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.
- Oh, just looking for ﬂying saucers, - he would joke and everyone would
laugh and ask him what sort of ﬂying saucers he was looking for.
- Green ones! - he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment
and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of
drinks.
Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on
whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases
that honestly the colour of the ﬂying saucers didn’t matter that much really.
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often
ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would
usually say something like:
- Don’t you think it’s about time you went oﬀ home sir?
- I’m trying to baby, I’m trying to, - is what Ford invariably replied on these
occasions.
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into
the night sky was any kind of ﬂying saucer at all. The reason he said green was
that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.
Ford Prefect was desperate that any ﬂying saucer at all would arrive soon
because ﬁfteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly
somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.
Ford wished that a ﬂying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how
to ﬂag ﬂying saucers down and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the
Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day.","The name chosen by Ford Prefect to blend into Earth society was ""Ford Prefect."""

87,"What was the reason behind Ford Prefect's choice of the name ""Ford Prefect""?","12 CHAPTER 1.
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-
descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended
from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse
and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.
This friend of his had ﬁrst arrived on the planet some ﬁfteen Earth years
previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society - with,
it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those ﬁfteen years
pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit
on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to
choose the name ”Ford Prefect” as being nicely inconspicuous.
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicu-
ously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from
the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There
was something very slightly odd about him, but it was diﬃcult to say what
it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn’t blink often enough and when you
talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on
his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people
the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but
a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he
would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun
of any astrophysicist he could ﬁnd till he got thrown out.
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into
the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he
would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.
- Oh, just looking for ﬂying saucers, - he would joke and everyone would
laugh and ask him what sort of ﬂying saucers he was looking for.
- Green ones! - he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment
and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of
drinks.
Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on
whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases
that honestly the colour of the ﬂying saucers didn’t matter that much really.
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often
ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would
usually say something like:
- Don’t you think it’s about time you went oﬀ home sir?
- I’m trying to baby, I’m trying to, - is what Ford invariably replied on these
occasions.
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into
the night sky was any kind of ﬂying saucer at all. The reason he said green was
that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.

of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never
Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bull-
dozer drivers accepted role to sit around drinking coﬀee and experimenting with
union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their ﬁnancial ad-
vantage.
The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.
The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.
A shadow moved across him again.

Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect

- Am I busy? - exclaimed Arthur. - Well, I’ve just got all these bulldozers
and things to lie in front of because they’ll knock my house down if I don’t, but
other than that... well, no not especially, why?
They don’t have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to

- And drink, - said Ford. - It’s vitally important that we talk and drink.

He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.

Ford glanced at him, puzzled.

- Ah.

ing game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the
madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was
played like this:
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each
of them.
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in
that ancient Orion mining song:
Oh don’t give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
No, don’t you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
For my head will ﬂy, my tongue will lie,
my eyes will fry and I may die
Won’t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit”).
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle
and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent - who would
then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be reﬁlled. The game would be played again. And
again.
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the
eﬀects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power.
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the ﬁnal loser
would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.
Ford Prefect usually played to lose.
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go
to the Horse and Groom after all.

- And he can’t because you’re lying in front of the bulldozers?

- I’m sure we can come to some arrangement, - said Ford. - Excuse me! he
shouted.
Mr. Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers
about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and
how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He was surprised and
slightly alarmed to ﬁnd that Arthur had company.

Mr. Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers
about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and
how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He was surprised and
slightly alarmed to ﬁnd that Arthur had company.
- Yes? Hello? - he called. - Has Mr. Dent come to his senses yet?
- Can we for the moment, - called Ford, - assume that he hasn’t?
- Well? - sighed Mr. Prosser.
- And can we also assume, - said Ford, - that he’s going to be staying here
all day?
- So?
- So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?
- Could be, could be...
- Well, if you’re resigned to doing that anyway, you don’t actually need him
to lie here all the time do you?
- What?
- You don’t, - said Ford patiently, - actually need him here.","The effect of Janx Spirit on telepsychic power is to depress it, making it harder for individuals to use their telepathic abilities."

ing game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the
madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was
played like this:
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each
of them.
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in
that ancient Orion mining song:
Oh don’t give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
No, don’t you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit
For my head will ﬂy, my tongue will lie,
my eyes will fry and I may die
Won’t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit”).
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle
and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent - who would
then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be reﬁlled. The game would be played again. And
again.
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the
eﬀects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power.
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the ﬁnal loser
would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.
Ford Prefect usually played to lose.
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go
to the Horse and Groom after all.
- But what about my house?.. - he asked plaintively.
Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck
him.
- He wants to knock your house down?
- Yes, he wants to build...
- And he can’t because you’re lying in front of the bulldozers?
- Yes, and...
- I’m sure we can come to some arrangement, - said Ford. - Excuse me! he
shouted.
